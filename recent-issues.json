However, this would not trigger GitHub autolinked reference feature. The commit message should be Closes https://github.com instead.\nFor those who are not familiar with autolinked reference feature, I did a simple experiment. I created an issue first li-boxuan/github-playground#1\nThen I create a pr, aiming to close that issue. See commit message https://github.com/li-boxuan/github-playground/pull/2/commits. However, after this pr gets merged, it doesn't close the corresponding issue automatically.\nFinally, this pr https://github.com/li-boxuan/github-playground/pull/3/commits closes the corresponding issue automatically when it's merged. Check commit messages carefully to see the difference.\nThat means we should check proper usage of https, at least for GitHub. Not sure if GitLab has similar features.","comments":0,"createdAt":"2018-09-01T06:09:48Z","updatedAt":"2018-09-01T06:13:36Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"li-boxuan","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/25746010?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"li-boxuan","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/25746010?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"area/ci","color":"d93f0b"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala-bears","updatedAtMs":1535295907000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/issues/2383","number":2383,"title":"Add

It has also been proven in this pr that when we remove the deploy of some pages Netlify passes.\nThe plan is to move the openhub and model apps from the community repo to a new Django app and then install and use that app in this repo. The work for that app is almost done at sks444/openhub-django#1 but I am getting an error while implementing it to this repo, though it's working with a normal Django website but this one is a static repo.\n@jayvdb, maybe we could get #152 merged to make the master green atm so that we could merge other prs? Until I am able to solve this problem with my new app.","comments":0,"createdAt":"2018-09-05T11:45:37Z","updatedAt":"2018-09-05T11:48:49Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"sks444","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/22263040?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"sks444","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/22263040?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"bug","color":"ee0701"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"community","updatedAtMs":1536544804000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/community/issues/191","number":191,"title":"Use upstream gci/client.py","body":"I've put the latest code in https://gitlab.com/GoogleCodeIn/api","comments":0,"createdAt":"2018-09-10T01:56:48Z","updatedAt":"2018-09-10T02:00:04Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"bug","color":"ee0701"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"community","updatedAtMs":1534479556000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/community/issues/182","number":182,"title":"Add support for Django 2.x","body":"We were initially using Django 2.x but at that time django-distill doesn't has the support for the same, so we downgraded to a lesser version.
