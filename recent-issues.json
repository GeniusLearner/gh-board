As soon as it encounters a control label(eg: for,if,set etc..), it appends those labels into the stack. Note that, we also maintain the end control label where ever necessary. Whenever an control tag is added and if it doesn't find it's endtag in the next line, The Indent step is increased. This is done, because if the endtag is not found on the nextline it basically means that we have nesting of instructions.\nEg:\n{% for tony in avengers %}\n{% for thanos in enemy %}\n{% set thanos == 'EVIL' %}\n{% endfor %}{# for thanos in enemy #}\n{% endfor %}{# for tony in avengers #}\n\nAs you see above after the first for, we do not have an endfor, that means we have a nesting in our Code. In such cases we append the first for in the stack. Now when it goes to the next line, it  checks if the next label matches the end label for the element present in the stack. That means, here we are checking if the next label is endfor. If it is then do nothing.\nIf it's not, then increase the Indent step , which is nothing but the number of spaces that has to be appended in front of a line. And check if the next line has that many number of indent steps. If not then create a diff.\nNow, when it encounters a endtag for the element present in the stack, it does two things\n\nDecreases the Indentaion Step\nPops out the element from the stack.\n\nThis is the basic working of the solution.\nThe above example get's indented as follows:\n{% for tony in avengers %}\n  {% for thanos in enemy %}\n    {% set thanos == 'EVIL' %}\n  {% endfor %}{# for thanos in enemy #}\n{% endfor %}{# for tony in avengers #}\n\nFor the cases where we have a code which has nested languages such as Jinja2 and Python. The lines from other languages are skipped. coala doesn't yet have the functionality to detect multiple languages.\nFor eg:\nimport sys\n{% for tony in avengers %}\n  {% for thanos in enemy %}\n                    print(\"Thanos Rocks!!\")\n          print(\"Testing Indentation\")\n{% set avengers = loose %}\n  {% endfor %}{# for thanos in enemy #}\n{% endfor %}{# for tony in avengers #}\n\nAfter the indentation, it would look like\nimport sys\n{% for tony in avengers %}\n  {% for thanos in enemy %}\n                   print(\"Thanos Rocks!!\")\n          print(\"Testing Indentation\")\n     {% set avengers = loose %}\n  {% endfor %}{# for thanos in enemy #}\n{% endfor %}{# for tony in avengers #}\n\nAs you see above, we provide no indentation  to both the print statements.

Take pyre_bad.py:2 for example.\n    return 'string'\npyre says the error happens on line 2, column 4.\nNow the problem comes:\nWhat is column 4? Is the first column numbered 0 or 1?\nBack to our example. It is clear that there are 4 spaces before return. Very likely, they consider the position of the first character of return, as the error position, i.e. the position of r. They call this position column 4. If that is the case, we can infer that they count column numbers from 0. However, coala counts from 1. column 4 needs to be converted into column 5 in coala.\nBut I am not sure.

A project-wide configuration file.\n+2. A user-wide configuration file.\n+3. A system-wide configuration file.\n+\n+Project-Wide configuration file\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+It is a convention that the project-wide configuration file is named\n+``.coafile.toml`` and lies in the project root directory.\n+If you follow this convention, simply executing ``coala -T`` from the\n+project root will execute the configuration specified in that file.\n+\n+Settings given in the project-wide configuration file override all settings\n+given by other files and can only be overridden by settings given via the\n+command line interface.\n+\n+User-Wide and System-Wide configuration file\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+You can place a ``.coarc.toml`` file in your home directory to set certain\n+user wide settings. Those settings will automatically be taken for all\n+projects executed with that user.\n+\n+All settings specified here override only settings given by the system\n+wide configuration file which has the lowest priority. The\n+``system_coafile.toml`` must lie in the coala installation directory\n+and is valid for everyone using this coala installation.\n+\n+It can be used to define the type of files you usually don't want to lint,\n+like minified files (e.g. ``*.min.js``) and backup files (e.g. ``*.orig``)::\n+\n+    ignore = [ '**.min.js', '**.orig' ]\n+\n+Basic TOML concepts\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+This part describes the basic TOML concepts required to write coala\n+configuration files in TOML\n+\n+- TOML is case sensitive. So remember to not have duplicate sections/tables\n+  or duplicate keys in same section.\n+- key-value pairs are building blocks of a TOML document. Use key-value\n+  pairs to specify rules for coala bears.\n+- A table is a collection of key-value pairs. Use a table for specifying\n+  a coala section.\n+\n+This is an example of a coala configuration file written in TOML ::\n+\n+    [cli]\n+    bears = 'SpaceConsistencyBear'\n+    files = 'src/*.c'\n+    use_spaces = true\n+\n+    [invalidlinks]\n+    enabled = false\n+    files = [ '**/*.rst', 'README.rst']\n+    ignore = 'venv/**'\n+    bears = 'InvalidLinkBear'\n+\n+\n+Here tables ``cli`` and ``invalidlinks`` are coala sections.\n+The contents of the tables like ``bears``, ``files`` are rules\n+that govern a section. To write coala configuration file you will\n+be using TOML strings, booleans, integers and arrays as values.\n+\n+Section Inheritance\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+coala supports section inheritance. You can define section inheritance\n+by using the key ``inherits``.\n+Extra values can be appended to an inherited setting using the ``appends`` key.\n+\n+Consider the following configuration file in TOML ::\n+\n+  [all]\n+  enabled = true\n+  overridable = 2\n+  ignore = 'vendor1/'\n+\n+  [section1]\n+  overridable = 3\n+  inherits = 'all'\n+  appends = 'ignore'\n+  ignore = 'vendor2/'\n+  other = 'some_value'\n+\n+  [section2]\n+  overridable = 4\n+  inherits = 'all'\n+  ignore = 'vendor3/'\n+  appends = 'ignore'\n+  other = 'some_other_value'\n+\n+\n+In the inherited sections above, ``appends`` key specifies that the value of\n+``ignore`` in the derived sections must be appended with the value of\n+``ignore`` key in the base section.\n+\n+This is the same file without section inheritance::\n+\n+  [all]\n+  enabled = true\n+  overridable = 2\n+  ignore = 'vendor1/'\n+\n+  [section1]\n+  enabled = true\n+  overridable = 3\n+  ignore = ['vendor1/', 'vendor2/']\n+  other = 'some_value'\n+\n+  [section2]\n+  enabled = true\n+  overridable = 4\n+  ignore = ['vendor1/', 'vendor3/']\n+  other = 'some_other_value'\n+\n+\n+Consider another example\n+\n+Config file in TOML\n+\n+::\n+\n+ [all]\n+ a = 1\n+ b = 2\n+\n+ [java]\n+ c = 3\n+ d = 4\n+\n+ [python]\n+ p = 5\n+ q = 6\n+ inherits = [ 'all', 'java']\n+\n+You can use this syntax to specify multiple inheritance\n+The same is coafile appears as\n+\n+::\n+\n+ [all]\n+ a = 1\n+ b = 2\n+\n+ [java]\n+ c = 3\n+ d = 4\n+\n+ [all.python]\n+ a = 1\n+ b = 2\n+ p = 5\n+ q = 6\n+\n+ [java.python]\n+ c = 3\n+ d = 4\n+ p = 5\n+ q = 6\n+\n+Defining Aspects and Tastes\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Aspects is an alternative way to configure coala.

You will\nlikely receive a lot of bot comments and build failures if coala does not\npass on every single commit!\n\nAfter you submit your pull request, DO NOT click the 'Update Branch' button.\nWhen asked for a rebase, consult coala.io/rebase\ninstead.\nPlease consider helping us by reviewing other peoples pull requests as well:\n\npick up any PR at https://coala.io/review\nreview it (check https://coala.io/reviewing for more info)\nif you are sure that it needs work, use cobot mark wip <URL> to get it out\nof the review queue.\n\nThe more you review, the more your score will grow at coala.io and we will\nreview your PRs faster!","comments":65,"createdAt":"2018-07-09T13:11:40Z","updatedAt":"2019-05-25T18:58:59Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"kriti21","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19872082?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"kriti21","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19872082?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"importance/critical","color":"b60205"},{"name":"process/pending review","color":"bfe5bf"},{"name":"size/S","color":"ededed"}],"pullRequest":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/projects/pull/600","comments":[{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDIwMTAwMjQ5Mg==","url":"https://github.com/coala/projects/pull/600#discussion_r201002492","bodyText":"This doesnt need to be moved.
