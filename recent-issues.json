And self.assertCountEqual has also been busted: the output is a mess.  We are breaking the standard Python testing tools, and replacing them with something less helpful.\nSo at the moment, with pytest and unittest builtin systems not working on Result objects, we are reliant on this Comparable class and this helper to actually help decode the problem.

Since the \"ADD BEAR\" text has been written within the  tag, the style \"font-family: FontAwesome\" automatically gets applied to the text.\nAt present only the:\nh1,\nh2,\nh3,\nh4,\nh5,\nh6 {\nfont-family: Roboto;\n}\nstyle is the best option from the http://github.com/coala/coalaCSS file to apply the Roboto font-family to the text. But this causes the styles of the materialize.css file heading tags to be applied automatically too.\n\nWe can define in a new class in the CoalaCSS file to attend to this particular issue. What do you suggest?","diffHunk":"@@ -146,7 +146,8 @@ <h4>Optional Settings</h4>\n         <div class=\"row blue-grey darken-4 white-text z-depth-1 no-margin\">\n           <span>\n             <a class=\"waves-effect grey-text text-lighten-2\">\n-              <i ng-click=\"add_bears(section)\" class=\"fa fa-plus-circle bears-icon-small\" aria-hidden=\"true\"> &nbsp;ADD BEAR\n+              <i ng-click=\"add_bears(section)\" class=\"fa fa-plus-circle bears-icon-small\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n+                &nbsp;<span style=\"font-family:'Roboto';\">ADD BEAR</span>","author":{"login":"Akhelesh","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/42298056?v=4","name":null},"reactions":[],"createdAt":"2018-08-15T17:32:34Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-08-15T17:32:34Z"},{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDIxMDcyMjU0NA==","url":"https://github.com/coala/landing-frontend/pull/284#discussion_r210722544","bodyText":"Yeah, new class in coalaCSS sounds good!","diffHunk":"@@ -146,7 +146,8 @@ <h4>Optional Settings</h4>\n         <div class=\"row blue-grey darken-4 white-text z-depth-1 no-margin\">\n           <span>\n             <a class=\"waves-effect grey-text text-lighten-2\">\n-              <i ng-click=\"add_bears(section)\" class=\"fa fa-plus-circle bears-icon-small\" aria-hidden=\"true\"> &nbsp;ADD BEAR\n+              <i ng-click=\"add_bears(section)\" class=\"fa fa-plus-circle bears-icon-small\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n+                &nbsp;<span style=\"font-family:'Roboto';\">ADD BEAR</span>","author":{"login":"hemangsk","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/13018570?v=4","name":"Hemang Kumar"},"reactions":[],"createdAt":"2018-08-16T19:56:29Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-08-16T19:56:29Z"},{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDIxMTA3OTQ1Ng==","url":"https://github.com/coala/landing-frontend/pull/284#discussion_r211079456","bodyText":"&nbsp;
