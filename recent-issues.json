New setting to expand layout of sub-objects up to a certain level","body":"I recently tried to use the JSONBear in my company, as we have a configuration-file like JSON there, which is manually maintained. It should be ordered alphabetically (that's what JSONBear already offers), but also contains many objects in an array that are very small and should be kept on a single line:\n{\n    \"stuff\": {\n        \"itemA\": {\"value\": 33, \"doubled\": 66},\n        \"itemB\": {\"value\": 44, \"doubled\": 88},\n        \"itemC\": {\"value\": 55, \"doubled\": 110},\n        \"itemD\": {\"value\": 66, \"doubled\": 132}\n    }\n}\nSo each line indicates a new item. When expanded, this looks too bloated:\n{\n  \"stuff\": {\n    \"itemA\": {\n      \"value\": 33,\n      \"doubled\": 66\n    },\n    \"itemB\": {\n      \"value\": 44,\n      \"doubled\": 88\n    },\n    \"itemC\": {\n      \"value\": 55,\n      \"doubled\": 110\n    },\n    \"itemD\": {\n      \"value\": 66,\n      \"doubled\": 132\n    }\n  }\n}\nSo I want a setting that allows me to control this expansion to a certain depth. For esxample in my case, I want to define something like expand_level=1, which will only expand the first level of the top-object, so only \"stuff\".\nIt's maybe also worth to have finer graded control for this as well for specific items, so new settings where you can specify which items to expand and which not.\nBut this should be done in another issue, noting this here so we don't forget.","comments":2,"createdAt":"2018-05-23T07:45:15Z","updatedAt":"2018-12-08T18:44:44Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"Makman2","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6023916?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"Makman2","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6023916?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"area/genericbears","color":"D01975"},{"name":"area/newsettings","color":"006b75"},{"name":"difficulty/low","color":"207de5"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala-bears","updatedAtMs":1544707840000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/issues/2503","number":2503,"title":"JSONFormatBear: Message not appropriate when settings are omitted","body":"This file can be reformatted by sorting keys and following indentation.\n\nis always displayed, regardless whether you have actually enabled json_sort (to sort keys) or not.

Take pyre_bad.py:2 for example.\n    return 'string'\npyre says the error happens on line 2, column 4.\nNow the problem comes:\nWhat is column 4? Is the first column numbered 0 or 1?\nBack to our example. It is clear that there are 4 spaces before return. Very likely, they consider the position of the first character of return, as the error position, i.e. the position of r. They call this position column 4. If that is the case, we can infer that they count column numbers from 0. However, coala counts from 1. column 4 needs to be converted into column 5 in coala.\nBut I am not sure. I don't know how they come up with column 4. Maybe they are referring to the last space before the word return, but chances are small. Maybe they have inconsistencies/bugs within their tool. You need to look up in their documentation (or even code), or ask them in their community.\nIt might not be an easy task, but such 'tiny' thing is important. coala needs to be accurate: sometimes upstream linters are not accurate, and we detect problems and help solve them.\nLet me know if my words are not clear enough 😉","diffHunk":"@@ -0,0 +1,65 @@\n+import os\n+import unittest\n+from queue import Queue\n+\n+from bears.python.PyreBear import PyreBear\n+from coalib.testing.BearTestHelper import generate_skip_decorator\n+from coalib.settings.Section import Section\n+\n+\n+def get_absolute_test_path(file):\n+    return os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__),\n+                        'pyre_test_files', file)\n+\n+\n+@generate_skip_decorator(PyreBear)\n+class PyreBearTest(unittest.TestCase):\n+\n+    def setUp(self):\n+        self.section = Section('pyre')\n+        self.queue = Queue()\n+        test_folder = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__),\n+                                   'pyre_test_files')\n+        self.test_good_file = os.path.join(test_folder,\n+                                           'pyre_test_good/pyre_good.py')\n+        self.test_bad_file = os.path.join(test_folder,\n+                                          'pyre_test_bad/pyre_bad.py')\n+\n+    def get_results(self, file):\n+        file_dict = {}\n+        with open(file, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as content:\n+            file_dict[file] = tuple(content.readlines())\n+        self.uut = PyreBear(file_dict,\n+                            self.section,\n+                            self.queue)\n+        if self.uut.run_bear_from_section([], {}) is None:\n+            return []\n+        return list(self.uut.run_bear_from_section([], {}))\n+\n+    def test_results(self):\n+        # Test Bad File\n+        results = self.get_results(self.test_bad_file)\n+        # Check Result Message(s)\n+        messages = [result.message for result in results]\n+        self.assertEqual(len(messages), 2)\n+        self.assertEqual(messages[0], 'Incompatible return type [7]: '\n+                         'Expected `int` but got `str`.')\n+        self.assertEqual(messages[1], 'Incompatible return type [7]: '\n+                         'Expected `str` but got `int`.')\n+        # Check Result Lines & Columns\n+        lines = [result.affected_code[0] for result in results]\n+        # For Message #1\n+        self.assertEqual(lines[0].end.column, 4)","author":{"login":"li-boxuan","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/25746010?v=4","name":"Boxuan Li"},"reactions":[{"id":"MDg6UmVhY3Rpb24zNDEzOTIzNg==","createdAt":"2018-12-18T12:44:18Z","content":"THUMBS_UP","user":{"login":"atb00ker","name":"Ajay Tripathi"}}],"createdAt":"2018-12-18T12:30:00Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-12-18T12:30:00Z"},{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDI0MzIzNDkxMA==","url":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/pull/2689#discussion_r243234910","bodyText":"Oh, yes, it's clear now, thank you. 😄\nIndeed, pyre is using 0-based offset for column and 1-based offset for row.\nThat should not be a problem, we can take the output from pyre and add 1 to column.
