It is therefore only able to identify code that is definitely not tested.\nThe most extreme examples of the problem are tests with no assertions. Fortunately these are uncommon in most code bases. Much more common is code that is only partially tested by its suite. A suite that only partially tests code can still execute all its branches (examples).\nAs it is actually able to detect whether each statement is meaningfully tested, mutation testing is the gold standard against which all other types of coverage are measured.\n\nAs far as I am concerned, checkstyle community uses mutation testing, which seems to be quite powerful.\nSee available mutation testing tools for python: https://github.com/theofidry/awesome-mutation-testing Unfortunately, none of them is very popular, and I have no idea how well they work.","comments":3,"createdAt":"2019-03-27T15:15:20Z","updatedAt":"2019-04-07T07:36:35Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"li-boxuan","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/25746010?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"li-boxuan","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/25746010?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"Project Proposal","color":"f9d0c4"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"projects","updatedAtMs":1554286687000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/projects/issues/718","number":718,"title":"Invalid project reference link to GSoC website for previous years proposals","body":"Currently, when we view any previous year completed projects report it contains a reference link to the GSoC website viewing that project but that link seems to be invalid because the GSoC has ended for that year and the data has been archived.

It would be better if the consistency of the logo is maintained.\nSteps to Reproduce\nOpen https://api.coala.io/en/latest/ in any mobile web browser (portrait mode)\nActual Results\n\nExpected Results\nIf the image scales while preserving aspect ratio and is aligned to the center or to the left, the logo would remain round.","comments":6,"createdAt":"2019-01-10T09:30:34Z","updatedAt":"2019-04-15T17:21:39Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"shashank-b","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/22676390?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"shashank-b","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/22676390?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"difficulty/newcomer","color":"0e8a16"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"landing-frontend","updatedAtMs":1554125189000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/landing-frontend/issues/293","number":293,"title":"Add an option of search in dropdown so that no need of sliding to search language ","body":"","comments":4,"createdAt":"2018-11-20T20:31:55Z","updatedAt":"2019-04-01T13:26:29Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"pandeynandancse","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/22164926?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"pandeynandancse","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/22164926?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"difficulty/newcomer","color":"0e8a16"},{"name":"type/bug","color":"ee0701"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"landing-frontend","updatedAtMs":1555350347000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/landing-frontend/issues/268","number":268,"title":"Add fork-me ribbon","body":"","comments":8,"createdAt":"2018-03-22T14:34:22Z","updatedAt":"2019-04-15T17:45:47Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"sangamcse","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/26381717?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"sangamcse","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/26381717?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"difficulty/low","color":"1d76db"},{"name":"needs-discussion","color":"aa52aa"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala-bears","updatedAtMs":1555821008000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/pull/2904","number":2904,"title":"PycodestyleBear: Process whole output","body":"This commit modifies process_output to\nprocess all the detected problems instead\nof just the first one.\nFixes #2882\nChecklist\n\n I read the commit guidelines and I've followed\nthem.\n I ran coala over my code locally.
