the README a kinder place by removing/replacing the John Woods quote","body":"This is migrated from #5767\nAs @joenash suggests,\nHey folks 👋\n\nThis PR is to discuss the removal of the John Woods quote from the README. I believe that quote is a product of its time (1991), and that Coala can do better to be a welcoming project.\nWe should write maintainable code because we have respect for our peers and colleagues who will read and work with it, not because of threat of death. The quote is also unnecessarily gendered.\n\nApologies also for the drive-by PR 🙇 For some additional context, I became aware of this quote because I work with a lot of software development students, and saw a large number were contributors to Coala. Coala is doing an amazing job of being accessible to students and upcoming software developers, but this also makes it important to ensure that students who work on this project are being taught respect for their fellow humans 💖\n\nI've added [WIP] as currently this commit removes the quote entirely. It may be more suitable to find an alternative to fill that space and act as the one-line pitch. If anyone has suggestions, please feel free to add them!\n\nSome follow-up discussions can be found on that PR. This issue is opened as the pull request is not a correct place to

PEP8NotebookBear is the very specific linter for them, but JSONFormatBear is also useful.\nDue to the fact json doesnt handle multi line strings, there is no sensible way to restrict the line length unless it is known that the contents will not use long lines, or should not contain long lines. e.g. if there are multiple ways of achieving something in the json, and the .coafile writer wants the people to only use inline for short strings and use a different approach for longer strings.  An artifical line length limit could also be used to prevent extremely deep nesting of objects.\nTherefore, the only sensible default setting for max_line_length is 0.\nHowever if someone knows the files only contains numbers and short fixed length strings, they can add a setting which overrides the default with a particular limit.\nWhen implementing this error, it is very important that the bear doesnt try to fix the problem, because it is unfixable.  The solution is the user must increase the setting in .coafile, or they must redesign their use of json.  The error should say this.","comments":0,"createdAt":"2018-10-29T14:06:45Z","updatedAt":"2018-11-04T10:13:18Z","closedAt":"2018-11-04T10:13:18Z","state":"closed","user":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"bkhanale","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/23272598?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"area/nativebear","color":"36c14d"},{"name":"difficulty/low","color":"207de5"},{"name":"importance/low","color":"70e870"},{"name":"type/feature","color":"0052cc"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala-bears","updatedAtMs":1541999257000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/issues/2746","number":2746,"title":"JSComplexityBear

deperately needs updating","body":"Pertinent files:\nresearch.zip\nAfter messing around setting up a development environment for a absurdly long time, I was able to run CPDBear, and there are numerous problmes which I ran into:\n\n\nCPDBear imports sub-libraries that don't exist in coalib (they likely once did exist, but not anymore)\n\n\nCPDBear uses packages like PWD and bash instead of the python os package\n\n\nCPDBear's language filtering cannot infer the language from a file type\n\n\nCPDBear uses language filtering, even though it's a simple enough bear that it's functionality should be implemented without language-specific AST parsing(it should probably just warn of similar code greater than length n)\n\n\nAfter debugging for a couple hours, the XML parsing broke entirely even though my code (provided in the .zip above) just passed the contents of files specified by --files into the parser\n\n\nThere is a language option which seems to be inaccessible through a command line switch, and rather you must type in the language directly into a CLI:\nPlease enter a value for the setting \"language\" (One of the supported languages of this bear.) needed by CPDBear for section \"cli\":\n\n\nMy recommendation is a complete overhaul or deletion of this file, and a investigation into if other example bears in general also use outdated or nonexistent imports.\nIf you want to replicate my results:\nGet a cloned version from master of coala-bears as of 11/3/2018\nInstall necessary dependencies from pip(there seems to be a problem with colorama versioning as of 11/3/2018) , so this is a struggle in its own right.\nUse setup.py install develop\nUpdate coala-bears/bears/general/CPDBear.py with the CPDBear.py file provided in the zip above, and cd into the

Leaderboard\n\nAddition of a new column named issues that will show all the labels of issues that user has solved.\nAddition of a Search bar where a user can search any username in case there is a long record displayed on the page and a filter option can also be provided where the user wants to view a set of records according to his needs.\nIf possible, we can add a new column in leaderboard which will display the total time taken by the user to solve all the issues that were assigned to him.\nInstead of displaying activities on the leaderboard page we can show these activities on the profile page (to be created) as it will save space on the leaderboard page and we can accumulate more data and columns.\nFiltering of records between GCI participants and NON-GCI participants.\n(Thinking on) Changing static website to dynamic website because the records of users are not static they change with time as they gain new skills, solve new issues, no more a GCI participant as they are have grown up etc.\n\n\n\nHomepage\n\nWe can show up a leaderboard that shows up top 10 contributors of the current month(a drop-down having options with the weekly, monthly or yearly view) and NON-GCI and GCI participants will have a separate leaderboard, will have a drop-down option.\n\n\n\nAdd Login/Sign-up using GitHub\n\n\nCreate Profile Page\n\nRequirements: User should be logged in using GitHub\nDisplay all user related information and stats like it's rank, issues solved by that user, graph, contribution details and many more.\n\n\n\nUser\n\nIf possible, we can store the contribution details of users i.e. how much a user has contributed to which repository/community more and we can display that data on the graph or in some other format.\nIn Leaderboard, we can set username a hyperlink which will link to a profile page of the user(to be created).\n\n\n\nImprovements\n\n\nGamification Leaderboard\n\nDisplay all rendered results in a table format because currently the results are shown in a paragraph format\nTo make it more creative, we can show some medals/badge emojis based on data in badges columns and show these emoji beside the username.\n\n\n\nUI\n\nRe-designing of the website and making it responsive so that it looks good on different devices.\nIn Inactive Issue and unassigned issues activity web pages, instead of showing just JSON they should be displayed in proper format with some extra important information.\nContributors and Meta-Review data web pages should be redesignedto make it look good.\n\n\n\nImprovements and Enhancements in projects website\nEnhancements\n\nIn reference to project proposal #394\n\nCurrently, the website shows all projects together (Completed, Disabled and Open projects). Instead of showing them together we can group this projects so that user can easily navigate to any section.\nA new section can be added that can show the count of grouped projects(e.g. their x open projects, y disabled projects and z completed projects).\nAlso, IMO we can show stats of projects like how many new projects proposals were accepted out which how many were completed and compare it with previous years data. (Thinking more on it if it can be more enhanced).\nSince coala provides a linter for the code so we can provide information on how a particular completed project will benefit other orgs.

system and derived gh-board layout, and support what @ryanprior likes, and what @coala needs, so that our patches will be able to make it back through the forks to the main repo (c.f. #2 )\nThere is one existing configuration item upstream, which is 'SAMPLE_REPOS' , and coala has added 'REPOSITORIES' for the pre-fetching.  I am surprised that there are no forks which have modified this (c.f. #5), as that seems like a logical easy way to improve the front page (c.f. #3).\nIncluding configuration in the master branch causes forks to diverge.  We need to avoid that.\nSome options for where to put the configuration:\n\nthe wiki\na different branch\nan issue ;-)\n\nOr, the configuration could be all derived from GitHub, if we ignore SAMPLE_REPOS. (and if we build a way to easily configure the front page, nobody will try to abuse this anyway.)  It will increase build time to extract an ideal layout based on GitHub org/repo metadata.

One way to do that is for  str(SourcePosition) to be implemented.\nAfter this initial PR, we can then also enhance ConfParser and allow Setting.origin to be given as a SourceRange to identify the precise start and end of each settings.  But that is later.  (You could do that in this PR if you wanted, but only it is easy to do.  Otherwise it is better to do this in stages.)\nThen the real fun begins when we consider section inheritance and +=, and even more funky when we consider #5532 .

Even if your .coafile is something like below where your [cli] section is not present. It would help you to know that the [ cli ] section is generated automatically by Cliparser.py when you supply the arguments to coala.

I tried to print the value of section.contents when the [ cli ] section is empty. It's something like:-\nOrderedDict([('comment0', <Setting object(key='comment0', value='', origin='/home/theprophet/git/thepursuit/oth/.coafile', from_cli=False, to_append=False) at 0x7f5ed01aa1d0>)])\n\n\nFrom the above result I can positively say that section always maintains elements in its dictionary even when a section is empty.This is done so that the core of coala can properly identify it.\nThat's the reason, you checking if len(section.contents) == 0 will not work.Since this doesn't work your if condition fails and the message Executing Section CLI will always prompt up.\nI guess you need to change your approach.\nP.S:- Please test your changes locally before creating a PR.

But do not print it when you do the same operation using a .coafile.\nExecuting section cli gets printed even when we supply no arguments to coala.\nIf there was no [ cli ] section in the .coafile then this could be solved by a very small change in your present solution.\n\n\nCheck if there is a section named [ cli ] in the .coafile and check if its contents are empty (Do not use section.contents 😅). If so do not print the message. If it isn't empty then print it. But then again, this is a kinda broader issue.\n\n\nI mean if we are checking if the section [ cli ] is empty and then avoid printing the message Executing section cli if it is. Shouldn't we avoid printing the section beginning message  for all the sections that have no content in them in the .coafile. I don't know if that's the scope of the issue.

Also, you should learn how to express complex technical ideas in the markup because if you can't explain your idea, and how you will achieve it, we probably won't be able to mentor you.","author":{"login":"KVGarg","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/35761292?v=4","name":"Keshav Garg"},"reactions":[],"createdAt":"2018-11-26T06:59:17Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-11-26T06:59:17Z"},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTMwMjcwMg==","url":"https://github.com/coala/projects/pull/693#issuecomment-441302702","bodyText":"Ok @CLiu13 ,I will make the suggested changes and will commit them soon.","diffHunk":null,"author":{"login":"KVGarg","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/35761292?v=4","name":"Keshav Garg"},"reactions":[{"id":"MDg6UmVhY3Rpb24zMjg4MjYyOQ==","createdAt":"2018-11-23T19:45:21Z","content":"THUMBS_UP","user":{"login":"CLiu13","name":"Charlie Liu"}}],"createdAt":"2018-11-23T18:49:39Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-11-23T18:49:39Z"},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTMwODI0Ng==","url":"https://github.com/coala/projects/pull/693#issuecomment-441308246","bodyText":"@CLiu13 Please check whether changes I made are correct or not !!\nThanks a lot","diffHunk":null,"author":{"login":"KVGarg","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/35761292?v=4","name":"Keshav Garg"},"reactions":[{"id":"MDg6UmVhY3Rpb24zMjg4MjYyNw==","createdAt":"2018-11-23T19:45:18Z","content":"THUMBS_UP","user":{"login":"CLiu13","name":"Charlie Liu"}}],"createdAt":"2018-11-23T19:35:32Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-11-23T19:35:32Z"},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTMxMjgxMA==","url":"https://github.com/coala/projects/pull/693#issuecomment-441312810","bodyText":"Done 😄","diffHunk":null,"author":{"login":"KVGarg","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/35761292?v=4","name":"Keshav Garg"},"reactions":[{"id":"MDg6UmVhY3Rpb24zMjg4MzM1MA==","createdAt":"2018-11-23T20:18:11Z","content":"THUMBS_UP","user":{"login":"CLiu13","name":"Charlie Liu"}}],"createdAt":"2018-11-23T20:16:54Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-11-23T20:16:54Z"},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTMxNTMxNw==","url":"https://github.com/coala/projects/pull/693#issuecomment-441315317","bodyText":"Ohk, I will look into it and will reword it 😃","diffHunk":null,"author":{"login":"KVGarg","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/35761292?v=4","name":"Keshav Garg"},"reactions":[],"createdAt":"2018-11-23T20:41:58Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-11-23T20:41:58Z"},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTQyMzA5OA==","url":"https://github.com/coala/projects/pull/693#issuecomment-441423098","bodyText":"Review request @li-boxuan @jayvdb","diffHunk":null,"author":{"login":"KVGarg","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/35761292?v=4","name":"Keshav Garg"},"reactions":[],"createdAt":"2018-11-25T08:13:27Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-11-25T08:13:27Z"},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTQ1MzQwOA==","url":"https://github.com/coala/projects/pull/693#issuecomment-441453408","bodyText":"@KVGarg  Use cEPs instead of cEP's.","diffHunk":null,"author":{"login":"bharatpurohit97","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/40547237?v=4","name":"Bharat purohit"},"reactions":[{"id":"MDg6UmVhY3Rpb24zMjkxMDgyMA==","createdAt":"2018-11-25T16:59:41Z","content":"THUMBS_UP","user":{"login":"KVGarg","name":"Keshav Garg"}}],"createdAt":"2018-11-25T16:33:36Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-11-25T16:33:36Z"}]}}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"projects","updatedAtMs":1541871098000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/projects/pull/690","number":690,"title":"List coala-quickstart repository under collaborating-projects","body":"For short term contributors: we understand that getting your commits well\ndefined like we require is a hard task and takes some learning.

While parsing the url it has to extract the information from the url that who is owner etc. like information but no idea why it isn't extracting the information for forked repositories. 😞\nActually I was also trying to solve this problem from morning due to which I have to debug the code and due to this only I asked you that whether the logo was visible or not.","diffHunk":null,"author":{"login":"KVGarg","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/35761292?v=4","name":"Keshav Garg"},"reactions":[{"id":"MDg6UmVhY3Rpb24zMjMzMzg1NQ==","createdAt":"2018-11-13T12:13:12Z","content":"THUMBS_UP","user":{"login":"bhawesh96","name":"Bhawesh Bhansali"}}],"createdAt":"2018-11-13T09:44:56Z","lastEditedAt":"2018-11-13T09:47:04Z","updatedAt":"2018-11-13T09:47:04Z"}]}}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"community","updatedAtMs":1542993453000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/community/pull/224","number":224,"title":"manage.py: Raise min python version to 3.6","body":"Raise an Exception if python version is < 3.6\nCloses #223","comments":3,"createdAt":"2018-11-18T12:01:51Z","updatedAt":"2018-11-23T17:17:33Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"bhawesh96","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/17593065?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"bhawesh96","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/17593065?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"bhawesh96","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/17593065?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"difficulty/low","color":"207de5"},{"name":"importance/medium","color":"ccf945"},{"name":"process/pending review","color":"9fe589"},{"name":"size/XS","color":"ededed"}],"pullRequest":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/community/pull/224","comments":[{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDIzNDczOTA2OQ==","url":"https://github.com/coala/community/pull/224#discussion_r234739069","bodyText":"version v3.6 is a bit redundant, since the v in v3.6 already means version.","diffHunk":"@@ -4,6 +4,8 @@\n \n \n if __name__ == '__main__':\n+    if (sys.version_info[0], sys.version_info[1]) < (3, 6):\n+        raise Exception('Minimum python version v3.6 is required.')","author":{"login":"CLiu13","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15334486?v=4","name":"Charlie Liu"},"reactions":[{"id":"MDg6UmVhY3Rpb24zMjY5ODE2NQ==","createdAt":"2018-11-20T13:59:45Z","content":"THUMBS_UP","user":{"login":"bhawesh96","name":"Bhawesh Bhansali"}}],"createdAt":"2018-11-19T18:52:36Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-11-19T18:52:36Z"},{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDIzNTAxMjI1NQ==","url":"https://github.com/coala/community/pull/224#discussion_r235012255","bodyText":"I have changed the text to 'Minimum python version 3.6 is required.'","diffHunk":"@@ -4,6 +4,8 @@\n \n \n if __name__ == '__main__':\n+    if (sys.version_info[0], sys.version_info[1]) < (3, 6):\n+        raise Exception('Minimum python version v3.6 is required.')","author":{"login":"bhawesh96","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/17593065?v=4","name":"Bhawesh Bhansali"},"reactions":[],"createdAt":"2018-11-20T14:00:22Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-11-20T14:00:22Z"}]}}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"community","updatedAtMs":1542178617000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/community/pull/210","number":210,"title":"DNM: GCI 2017 issue data","body":"Adds issues.yaml used by #206\nAdds example issues.yaml to be used by #206\nNot to be merged, as this is too coala specific.\nWe need to find an alternative storage location for this.","comments":3,"createdAt":"2018-10-16T10:35:55Z","updatedAt":"2018-11-14T06:56:57Z","closedAt":"2018-11-14T06:56:57Z","state":"closed","user":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"process/pending review","color":"9fe589"},{"name":"size/XL","color":"ededed"}],"pullRequest":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/community/pull/210","comments":[{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzODU1ODIzNw==","url":"https://github.com/coala/community/pull/210#issuecomment-438558237","bodyText":"No longer needed","diffHunk":null,"author":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4","name":"John Vandenberg"},"createdAt":"2018-11-14T06:56:57Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-11-14T06:56:57Z"}]}}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"community","updatedAtMs":1541155919000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/community/pull/217","number":217,"title":".moban.yaml: Disable openhub module","body":"openhub app is broken at the moment which\nis causing netlify to fail.

Retry sometimes solves the problem.\nUPDATE:\nSo from my experiment and observation, it is a bug with upstream project graphql-client.\nhttps://github.com/nordsimon/graphql-client/blob/f8d1dcba8a65f290e35b71c883a18094594d6d5a/index.js#L2\ncan lead to an error when elements in errors array don't have locations field.\nHowever, GitHub is supposed to include the locations field when returning errors.\nFor example, a normal errors should be sth like this:\n[{\"message\":\"Could not resolve to an Organization with the login of 'GCI-AOSSIE'.\",\"type\":\"NOT_FOUND\",\"path\":[\"organization\"],\"locations\":[{\"line\":2,\"column\":3}]}]\nHowever, sometimes GitHub returns this:\n[{\"message\":\"Something went wrong while executing your query. This may be the result of a timeout, or it could be a GitHub bug. Please include `E689:1AF6:67E816:BAAF4C:5BD321E1` when reporting this issue.\"}]\nwhich causes the error of graphql-client.\nCONCLUSION: a bug of upstream project graphql-client. It only happens occasionally, coz it's caused due to some unknown error of GitHub.\nUPDATE 2:\nCreated an issue #163","diffHunk":null,"author":{"login":"li-boxuan","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/25746010?v=4","name":"Boxuan Li"},"createdAt":"2018-10-26T06:34:20Z","lastEditedAt":"2018-10-26T14:53:21Z","updatedAt":"2018-10-26T14:53:21Z"},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMzU3ODQ2Mw==","url":"https://github.com/coala/gci-leaders/pull/161#issuecomment-433578463","bodyText":"@andrewda Yep, this is to be merged after #157.","diffHunk":null,"author":{"login":"li-boxuan","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/25746010?v=4","name":"Boxuan Li"},"createdAt":"2018-10-27T01:02:54Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-10-27T01:02:54Z"},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMzU5NzA3Mg==","url":"https://github.com/coala/gci-leaders/pull/161#issuecomment-433597072","bodyText":"@li-boxuan , can you add a commit to fix the year.
