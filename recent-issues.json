then causes further problems in PRs like #4179 (comment)\nThe above test needs anyway some redesign according to #4862 whereby apply_single=True should just not be used\nask_for_actions_and_apply needs to raise some exception on invalid apply_single values\ncc @mrtes @Nosferatul @Adrianzatreanu

At least nothing can get merged, and then other breakages occur and are not easily spotted.\nThe tree needs to stay green.\nA particularly difficult open case is #1472 (gotype deleted).\nBut in the last week we've also had a four day red period due to #1461 (checkstyle jar corruption) , and while that was broken #1470 (ramllint breakage) also occurred but wasnt noticed and fixed promptly.\nTo avoid these prolonged red tree periods easily, we need to disable broken bears from all CI if they are not able to be fixed immediately.\nIdeally this flagged status appears in the Bear code itself, so that the brokenness can also be reported to users.  In most cases, if a bear is broken on our CI, it is very likely users will also be seeing the same problems.  The only time this isnt true is if it is a Linux problem with our trusty CI workers that doesnt occur on more recent Ubuntu or other distros.","comments":10,"createdAt":"2017-03-04T05:21:08Z","updatedAt":"2019-08-04T13:06:41Z","closedAt":"2019-08-04T13:06:41Z","state":"closed","user":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"difficulty/medium","color":"0052cc"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"documentation","updatedAtMs":1565111417000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/documentation/issues/597","number":597,"title":"Add documentation on how to write configuration in TOML","body":"","comments":0,"createdAt":"2019-06-15T19:24:41Z","updatedAt":"2019-08-06T17:10:17Z","closedAt":"2019-08-06T17:10:17Z","state":"closed","user":{"login":"PrajwalM2212","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/30733262?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"PrajwalM2212","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/30733262?v=4"},"labels":[]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"projects","updatedAtMs":1566128508000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/projects/issues/734","number":734,"title":"Add a tab displaying GSoC Students ","body":"","comments":0,"createdAt":"2019-08-13T11:55:58Z","updatedAt":"2019-08-18T11:41:48Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"KVGarg","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/35761292?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"KVGarg","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/35761292?v=4"},"labels":[]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"projects","updatedAtMs":1565353791000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/projects/issues/728","number":728,"title":"Fetch mentors from Webservices","body":"Created a merge request in webservices, that creates a new table for mentors.

So this function tries to infer the datatype from the string for toml in coafile to toml conversion.\nAre you sure this will return the expected type everytime?\nIt handles strings, booleans and list of strings and integers.\nThese are the settings types I have seen used by coala . If more types are used like floats, then then this function can make a provision for that as well.\nSo I think for now it returns the expected types.\nWhere it fails and why failing does not matter\nIf someone writes a = 20 in coafile and wants to mean 20 as a string and not a integer, then this function will fail as it always assumes 20 to be an integer.\nEven if the function fails, it will not break down the functionality. It may appear as an integer in a toml file, but when coala is run all settings will become one single string.\nSo function can fail only in purpose but not in functionality.\nAlso coafile configuration provides no means to specify the data-type in configuration file. So we can make the approximation that makes the best sense for our use-case as there is no source of truth or loss of functionality.","diffHunk":"@@ -0,0 +1,177 @@\n+import os\n+\n+from

As soon as it encounters a control label(eg: for,if,set etc..), it appends those labels into the stack. Note that, we also maintain the end control label where ever necessary. Whenever an control tag is added and if it doesn't find it's endtag in the next line, The Indent step is increased. This is done, because if the endtag is not found on the nextline it basically means that we have nesting of instructions.\nEg:\n{% for tony in avengers %}\n{% for thanos in enemy %}\n{% set thanos == 'EVIL' %}\n{% endfor %}{# for thanos in enemy #}\n{% endfor %}{# for tony in avengers #}\n\nAs you see above after the first for, we do not have an endfor, that means we have a nesting in our Code. In such cases we append the first for in the stack. Now when it goes to the next line, it  checks if the next label matches the end label for the element present in the stack. That means, here we are checking if the next label is endfor. If it is then do nothing.\nIf it's not, then increase the Indent step , which is nothing but the number of spaces that has to be appended in front of a line. And check if the next line has that many number of indent steps. If not then create a diff.\nNow, when it encounters a endtag for the element present in the stack, it does two things\n\nDecreases the Indentaion Step\nPops out the element from the stack.\n\nThis is the basic working of the solution.\nThe above example get's indented as follows:\n{% for tony in avengers %}\n  {% for thanos in enemy %}\n    {% set thanos == 'EVIL' %}\n  {% endfor %}{# for thanos in enemy #}\n{% endfor %}{# for tony in avengers #}\n\nFor the cases where we have a code which has nested languages such as Jinja2 and Python. The lines from other languages are skipped. coala doesn't yet have the functionality to detect multiple languages.\nFor eg:\nimport sys\n{% for tony in avengers %}\n  {% for thanos in enemy %}\n                    print(\"Thanos Rocks!!\")\n          print(\"Testing Indentation\")\n{% set avengers = loose %}\n  {% endfor %}{# for thanos in enemy #}\n{% endfor %}{# for tony in avengers #}\n\nAfter the indentation, it would look like\nimport sys\n{% for tony in avengers %}\n  {% for thanos in enemy %}\n                   print(\"Thanos Rocks!!\")\n          print(\"Testing Indentation\")\n     {% set avengers = loose %}\n  {% endfor %}{# for thanos in enemy #}\n{% endfor %}{# for tony in avengers #}\n\nAs you see above, we provide no indentation  to both the print statements.

You can define section inheritance\n+by using the key ``inherits``.\n+Extra values can be appended to an inherited setting using the ``appends`` key.\n+\n+Consider the following configuration file in TOML\n+\n+.. code::\n+\n+  [all]\n+  enabled = true\n+  overridable = 2\n+  ignore = 'vendor1/'\n+\n+  [section1]\n+  overridable = 3\n+  inherits = 'all'\n+  appends = 'ignore'\n+  ignore = 'vendor2/'\n+  other = 'some_value'\n+\n+  [section2]\n+  overridable = 4\n+  inherits = 'all'\n+  ignore = 'vendor3/'\n+  appends = 'ignore'\n+  other = 'some_other_value'\n+\n+\n+In the inherited sections above, ``appends`` key specifies that the value of\n+``ignore`` in the derived sections must be appended with the value of\n+``ignore`` key in the base section.\n+\n+This is the same file without section inheritance\n+\n+.. code::\n+\n+  [all]\n+  enabled = true\n+  overridable = 2\n+  ignore = 'vendor1/'\n+\n+  [section1]\n+  enabled = true\n+  overridable = 3\n+  ignore = ['vendor1/', 'vendor2/']\n+  other = 'some_value'\n+\n+  [section2]\n+  enabled = true\n+  overridable = 4\n+  ignore = ['vendor1/', 'vendor3/']\n+  other = 'some_other_value'\n+\n+\n+Consider another example\n+\n+Config file in TOML\n+\n+.. code::\n+\n+ [all]\n+ a = 1\n+ b = 2\n+\n+ [java]\n+ c = 3\n+ d = 4\n+\n+ [python]\n+ p = 5\n+ q = 6\n+ inherits = [ 'all', 'java']\n+\n+You can use this syntax to specify multiple inheritance\n+The same in coafile format appears as\n+\n+.. code::\n+\n+ [all]\n+ a = 1\n+ b = 2\n+\n+ [java]\n+ c = 3\n+ d = 4\n+\n+ [all.python]\n+ a = 1\n+ b = 2\n+ p = 5\n+ q = 6\n+\n+ [java.python]\n+ c = 3\n+ d = 4\n+ p = 5\n+ q = 6\n+\n+.. note::\n+\n+   - If you want to append multiple settings then use ``appends`` as a list\n+     ::\n+\n+        appends = [ 'a', 'b']\n+   - If you want to inherit multiple sections use ``inherits`` as a list\n+     ::\n+\n+        inherits = [ 'section1', 'section2']\n+   - You can only inherit sections\n+   - You can only append settings\n+   - If  a setting is redefined in the inherited section then it will\n+     overwritten if appends is not used.\n+\n+Defining Aspects and Tastes\n+----------------------------\n+\n+Aspects is an alternative way to configure coala. In this mode, we don't need\n+to explicitly state list of bears, coala will choose it automatically based on\n+requested aspects in configuration file. To run coala in this mode, we need to\n+define `aspects`, `files`, `languages`, and optionally aspect tastes setting.\n+See the following example\n+\n+.. code::\n+\n+  [all]\n+  files = '**'\n+  aspects = ['aspectname1', 'AspectName2'] # case-insensitive\n+  # defining an aspect's taste\n+  aspectname1.aspect_taste = 80\n+  # we can define subaspect taste through its parent\n+  aspectname1.subaspect_taste = ['word1', 'word2', 'word3']\n+\n+  [python]\n+  files = '**.py'\n+  language = 'Python'\n+  inherits = 'all'\n+  # appending additional aspect\n+  appends = 'all'\n+  aspects = 'aspectname3'\n+  # excluding certain subaspect\n+  excludes = 'AspectName2Subaspect'\n+\n+For caofile users who want to write configuration in TOML","author":{"login":"Nosferatul","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/15227444?v=4","name":"Alexandru-Sorin

I will make the whole card clickable. What will make it more good is that we can add a href to each row which when clicked will redirect the user to the same user-details card on which the user has clicked.\n\nCan you make the whole card clickable instead of just the footer?\n\nI tried to give them same color (all green color variants being used in website) but it wasn't looking good, it was giving a dull-like experience. Currently, both of them are having that background colors which are going in match with header, body-background as well as text. Also, the yellow-orange color combination is one of the famous combinations.\n\nI also think that these cards should look similar(in color, etc.)\n\nWe can surely do that! but the only issue is space, we can't separate the current main-content div into two div blocks in which one div block will be used for a single card. Also, if we don't choose to create partitions then the concern is where will it be shown at top or bottom of page. Neither of the positions will have a nice UX experience. Showing at home-page will give user a glance giving a nice UX experience and with giving them an additional information that the website has two types of leaderboards related to contribs. And, a new-user to website always recognizes the website by its homepage and easy-navigability.\n\nwith the individual cards on their respective pages.
