I believe that quote is a product of its time (1991), and that Coala can do better to be a welcoming project.\nWe should write maintainable code because we have respect for our peers and colleagues who will read and work with it, not because of threat of death. The quote is also unnecessarily gendered.\n\nApologies also for the drive-by PR 🙇 For some additional context, I became aware of this quote because I work with a lot of software development students, and saw a large number were contributors to Coala. Coala is doing an amazing job of being accessible to students and upcoming software developers, but this also makes it important to ensure that students who work on this project are being taught respect for their fellow humans 💖\n\nI've added [WIP] as currently this commit removes the quote entirely. It may be more suitable to find an alternative to fill that space and act as the one-line pitch. If anyone has suggestions, please feel free to add them!\n\nSome follow-up discussions can be found on that PR.

and FileProxy fixes","body":"fbe8452 introduced FileDict, as a subclass of dict.\nIt contains many unnecessary methods which needlessly override the dict method.  The override methods mostly just call the super() method, creating an extra performance degradation.\nThe only method which isnt just super() is __getitem__.  It contains a bug, because if the value in the dict has 0 lines, val is [] , and if val: will be false, and None is returned instead of [].  That is wildly different behaviour to previously, as None is not iterable.  It means all code (including global bears) needs to check whether the file is None before iterating over the file contents.  File contents being None was previously possible, but only when 'raw' mode was enabled.  A file with 0 lines is not the same as an unreadable / raw file.\nFileFactory was introduced in b06dfe4.  The most critical problem is that it is not a \"factory\".  Factories are an extremely important and very well established pattern covered in all OO books with buying ( https://www.oodesign.com/factory-pattern.html ), so to call this a factory is very confusing / misleading.\nIt was to be a wrapper for a \"file\" object, which was previously a list of str, where each item was a line of the file.  While a design goal was to hide some of the details, it still needs to be backwards compatible in order to avoid breaking existing code.  This is especially important at the moment given that the current status of coala is so bug ridden with many regressions that investigating bugs requires installing from old git commits more than a year to verify the old behaviour.\nTwo \"list\" unimplemented methods which were used by coala-quickstart are __len__ and __getitem__.  These missing methods need to be re-implemented.  If there is a good justification for deprecating them, that deprecation should be done properly.  For __len__, it seems unjustifiable to not provide this, as this single number can be cached and provides a lot of information, and is especially helpful if avoiding re-reading files which have been evicted from the cache, as a 0 line file can be more efficiently created in memory than re-reading from the disk.  __getitem__ is much easier to justify deprecating if the file contents are being evicted from the cache to reduce the memory footprint of coala.  That hasnt been implemented yet.","comments":0,"createdAt":"2018-10-13T18:57:47Z","updatedAt":"2018-10-17T11:22:38Z","closedAt":"2018-10-17T11:22:38Z","state":"closed","user":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"labels":[]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala","updatedAtMs":1540784434000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/5812","number":5812,"title":"LocalBearTestHelper:

I have see this type of python program first time with meta data.\n\n@rishabhgarg25699 Python has been used to write the test file. It's similiar to GnuIndentBearTest. It would also help you if you understand what the role of PEP8NotebookBear is. Just go through the doc-string of the file, the test file will make more sense to you.\n\nI have also to made only function for test at last of program ?\n\nPlease try to understand the process. You could actually get enough idea on writing the tests on seeing the two PR which have been attached.\nI'll give you few hints:-\n\nYou need to make a file which has more than 80 characters in PEP8NoteBookBearTest.py. Have a look at the source field section in the good file field of PEP8NoteBookBearTest.py . Just have a look at other similar PR's\nOnce you create the above file you can then create the function( take reference from the PR's mentioned by @newbazz in the issue) in which you will have to append the settings of maxlength and voila you would have successfully written your tests. :)\n\nHope you could solve this issue now.

This may be the result of a timeout, or it could be a GitHub bug. Please include `E689:1AF6:67E816:BAAF4C:5BD321E1` when reporting this issue.\"}]\nwhich causes the error of graphql-client.\nCONCLUSION: a bug of upstream project graphql-client.
