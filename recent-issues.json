I believe that quote is a product of its time (1991), and that Coala can do better to be a welcoming project.\nWe should write maintainable code because we have respect for our peers and colleagues who will read and work with it, not because of threat of death. The quote is also unnecessarily gendered.\n\nApologies also for the drive-by PR 🙇 For some additional context, I became aware of this quote because I work with a lot of software development students, and saw a large number were contributors to Coala. Coala is doing an amazing job of being accessible to students and upcoming software developers, but this also makes it important to ensure that students who work on this project are being taught respect for their fellow humans 💖\n\nI've added [WIP] as currently this commit removes the quote entirely. It may be more suitable to find an alternative to fill that space and act as the one-line pitch. If anyone has suggestions, please feel free to add them!\n\nSome follow-up discussions can be found on that PR.

and FileProxy fixes","body":"fbe8452 introduced FileDict, as a subclass of dict.\nIt contains many unnecessary methods which needlessly override the dict method.  The override methods mostly just call the super() method, creating an extra performance degradation.\nThe only method which isnt just super() is __getitem__.  It contains a bug, because if the value in the dict has 0 lines, val is [] , and if val: will be false, and None is returned instead of [].  That is wildly different behaviour to previously, as None is not iterable.  It means all code (including global bears) needs to check whether the file is None before iterating over the file contents.  File contents being None was previously possible, but only when 'raw' mode was enabled.  A file with 0 lines is not the same as an unreadable / raw file.\nFileFactory was introduced in b06dfe4.  The most critical problem is that it is not a \"factory\".  Factories are an extremely important and very well established pattern covered in all OO books with buying ( https://www.oodesign.com/factory-pattern.html ), so to call this a factory is very confusing / misleading.\nIt was to be a wrapper for a \"file\" object, which was previously a list of str, where each item was a line of the file.  While a design goal was to hide some of the details, it still needs to be backwards compatible in order to avoid breaking existing code.  This is especially important at the moment given that the current status of coala is so bug ridden with many regressions that investigating bugs requires installing from old git commits more than a year to verify the old behaviour.\nTwo \"list\" unimplemented methods which were used by coala-quickstart are __len__ and __getitem__.  These missing methods need to be re-implemented.  If there is a good justification for deprecating them, that deprecation should be done properly.  For __len__, it seems unjustifiable to not provide this, as this single number can be cached and provides a lot of information, and is especially helpful if avoiding re-reading files which have been evicted from the cache, as a 0 line file can be more efficiently created in memory than re-reading from the disk.  __getitem__ is much easier to justify deprecating if the file contents are being evicted from the cache to reduce the memory footprint of coala.  That hasnt been implemented yet.","comments":0,"createdAt":"2018-10-13T18:57:47Z","updatedAt":"2018-10-17T11:22:38Z","closedAt":"2018-10-17T11:22:38Z","state":"closed","user":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"labels":[]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala","updatedAtMs":1541054794000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/5812","number":5812,"title":"LocalBearTestHelper: Proper deprecation for timeout","body":"#5723 was an over-hasty way of removing the dependency on pytest.\nThe assert not timeout broke one of the bears which used the timeout.\nThe bear was updated to remove the unnecessary timeout, but the assert will break old versions of coala-bears being used with the current coalib, which needlessly complicates setting up an environment to investigate old bugs.\nIt should be properly deprecated with a warning that the timeout is ignored.","comments":2,"createdAt":"2018-10-13T19:22:33Z","updatedAt":"2018-11-01T06:46:34Z","closedAt":"2018-11-01T06:46:34Z","state":"closed","user":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"aquatiko","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/23431811?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"difficulty/low","color":"207de5"},{"name":"importance/medium","color":"fbca04"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala","updatedAtMs":1540135156000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/5819","number":5819,"title":"Writing Good Commits should use real commits as examples","body":"https://api.coala.io/en/latest/Developers/Writing_Good_Commits.html\nThe example commits include references to issues, however those issues are not the same as the examples.\ne.g. coala/documentation#573 is about a commit example which refers to #4018 , but that issue was solved in PR #4024 , and the commit b430755 , which has a very different commit message than the one in the example.\nFor newcomers, that would be very confusing if they explore the examples.","comments":5,"createdAt":"2018-10-15T00:18:05Z","updatedAt":"2018-10-21T15:19:16Z","closedAt":"2018-10-21T15:19:16Z","state":"closed","user":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"blossomica","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6190813?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"area/documentation","color":"bfe5bf"},{"name":"difficulty/low","color":"207de5"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala","updatedAtMs":1539662906000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/5820","number":5820,"title":"Remove unnecessary blank line","body":"coala/coalib/bearlib/languages/definitions/Python.py\n    \n    \n         Line 8\n      in\n      604072c\n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n        \n          \n            \n        \n    \n  \n\n\nNewcomer Issue","comments":4,"createdAt":"2018-10-15T15:08:56Z","updatedAt":"2018-10-16T04:08:26Z","closedAt":"2018-10-16T04:08:26Z","state":"closed","user":{"login":"srivama","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/17855807?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"srivama","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/17855807?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"rpanczer","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/15878614?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"difficulty/newcomer","color":"65C8FF"},{"name":"type/bug","color":"e11d21"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala","updatedAtMs":1539239426000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/5605","number":5605,"title":"Newcomers_Guide.rst: display \"move on to more difficult issues\" message as note block","body":"On Newcomers Guide page there is a message saying:\n\nNote: After you have solved a difficulty/newcomer issue, please don’t take up any more.

python os package\n\n\nCPDBear's language filtering cannot infer the language from a file type\n\n\nCPDBear uses language filtering, even though it's a simple enough bear that it's functionality should be implemented without language-specific AST parsing(it should probably just warn of similar code greater than length n)\n\n\nAfter debugging for a couple hours, the XML parsing broke entirely

Implement max_line_length with default 0","body":"This is similar in nature to #1754\n#2742 was a recent merge related to max line length for ipython files.\nJSONFormatBear is a valid linter for ipython files, which are json with a different file extension and specific contents.   PEP8NotebookBear is the very specific linter for them, but JSONFormatBear is also useful.\nDue to the fact json doesnt handle multi line strings, there is no sensible way to restrict the line length unless it is known that the contents will not use long lines, or should not contain long lines. e.g. if there are multiple ways of achieving something in the json, and the .coafile writer wants the people to only use inline for short strings and use a different approach for longer strings.  An artifical line length limit could also be used to prevent extremely deep nesting of objects.\nTherefore, the only sensible default setting for max_line_length is 0.\nHowever if someone knows the files only contains numbers and short fixed length strings, they can add a setting which overrides the default with a particular limit.\nWhen implementing this error, it is very important that the bear doesnt try to fix the problem, because it is unfixable.  The solution is the user must increase the setting in .coafile, or they must redesign their use of json.

I created an issue first li-boxuan/github-playground#1\nThen I create a pr, aiming to close that issue. See commit message https://github.com/li-boxuan/github-playground/pull/2/commits.

In order to open a file to a particular location, the command goes:\n$code <file_name>:{line}:{column} -g. Here the -g is mandatory.

One way to do that is for  str(SourcePosition) to be implemented.\nAfter this initial PR, we can then also enhance ConfParser and allow Setting.origin to be given as a SourceRange to identify the precise start and end of each settings.  But that is later.  (You could do that in this PR if you wanted, but only it is easy to do.

I believe that quote is a product of its time (1991), and that Coala can do better to be a welcoming project.\nWe should write maintainable code because we have respect for our peers and colleagues who will read and work with it, not because of threat of death. The quote is also unnecessarily gendered.\nApologies also for the drive-by PR 🙇  For some additional context, I became aware of this quote because I work with a lot of software development students, and saw a large number were contributors to Coala. Coala is doing an amazing job of being accessible to students and upcoming software developers, but this also makes it important to ensure that students who work on this project are being taught respect for their fellow humans 💖\nI've added [WIP] as currently this commit removes the quote entirely.

Even if your .coafile is something like below where your [cli] section is not present.

I rarely used a [ cli ] section on my projects. I might be as well be wrong here 😅 . Better confirm it.\nIn any case, I guess this issue has two parts:-\n\n\nPrint Executing Section CLI only when the coala is provided with options. eg:-\ncoala --file = avenger.py --bears SpaceConsistencyBear, print the message Executing Section CLI when you execute this. But do not print it when you do the same operation using a .coafile.\nExecuting section cli gets printed even when we supply no arguments to coala.\nIf there was no [ cli ] section in the .coafile then this could be solved by a very small change in your present solution.\n\n\nCheck if there is a section named [ cli ] in the .coafile and check if its contents are empty (Do not use section.contents 😅). If so do not print the message. If it isn't empty then print it. But then again, this is a kinda broader issue.\n\n\nI mean if we are checking if the section [ cli ] is empty and then avoid printing the message Executing section cli if it is. Shouldn't we avoid printing the section beginning message  for all the sections that have no content in them in the .coafile. I don't know if that's the scope of the issue.

I have see this type of python program first time with meta data.\n\n@rishabhgarg25699 Python has been used to write the test file. It's similiar to GnuIndentBearTest. It would also help you if you understand what the role of PEP8NotebookBear is. Just go through the doc-string of the file, the test file will make more sense to you.\n\nI have also to made only function for test at last of program ?\n\nPlease try to understand the process. You could actually get enough idea on writing the tests on seeing the two PR which have been attached.\nI'll give you few hints:-\n\nYou need to make a file which has more than 80 characters in PEP8NoteBookBearTest.py.
