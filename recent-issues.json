The mapping isnt exact, but the benefits of using the test result format is tight integration with various system.\nCircleCI can accept this format: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/collect-test-data/\nAppVeyor can receive a test results XML format, in the format output by xunit, presumably the same as JUnit.\nhttps://www.appveyor.com/docs/running-tests/#uploading-xml-test-results\nThe first project phase could involve converting the JSON to JUnit format and uploading into Circle CI and Appveyor.\nThe JUnit format should also be tested with a Jenkins install, to ensure it is uploading correctly there.  This would mean our Jenkins project is much less important.\nAnother common format is TAP.\nAnd there is Clover XML format.\nThen there are some system, such as Phabricator, which have a custom format they expect.\nc.f. facebook/infer#673\nThe above probably doesnt fill 3 months.\nPulling the coala results from CI using this format could be a way to inform newbies of the style problems with their PRs.\nAnother way to expand this project is to also push the unit test results as XML to the CI (using combination XML files if necessary)","comments":19,"createdAt":"2018-04-17T11:07:57Z","updatedAt":"2019-05-07T12:19:25Z","closedAt":"2019-05-07T12:19:25Z","state":"closed","user":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"li-boxuan","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/25746010?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"Project Proposal","color":"f9d0c4"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"corobo","updatedAtMs":1558549034000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/corobo/issues/660","number":660,"title":"Corobo repo needs moban sync ","body":"After the recent build failure due to the upstream changed xdist and pytest versions the moban repo has been updated due to which this repo needs syncing.

As soon as it encounters a control label(eg: for,if,set etc..), it appends those labels into the stack. Note that, we also maintain the end control label where ever necessary. Whenever an control tag is added and if it doesn't find it's endtag in the next line, The Indent step is increased. This is done, because if the endtag is not found on the nextline it basically means that we have nesting of instructions.\nEg:\n{% for tony in avengers %}\n{% for thanos in enemy %}\n{% set thanos == 'EVIL' %}\n{% endfor %}{# for thanos in enemy #}\n{% endfor %}{# for tony in avengers #}\n\nAs you see above after the first for, we do not have an endfor, that means we have a nesting in our Code. In such cases we append the first for in the stack. Now when it goes to the next line, it  checks if the next label matches the end label for the element present in the stack. That means, here we are checking if the next label is endfor. If it is then do nothing.\nIf it's not, then increase the Indent step , which is nothing but the number of spaces that has to be appended in front of a line. And check if the next line has that many number of indent steps. If not then create a diff.\nNow, when it encounters a endtag for the element present in the stack, it does two things\n\nDecreases the Indentaion Step\nPops out the element from the stack.\n\nThis is the basic working of the solution.\nThe above example get's indented as follows:\n{% for tony in avengers %}\n  {% for thanos in enemy %}\n    {% set thanos == 'EVIL' %}\n  {% endfor %}{# for thanos in enemy #}\n{% endfor %}{# for tony in avengers #}\n\nFor the cases where we have a code which has nested languages such as Jinja2 and Python. The lines from other languages are skipped. coala doesn't yet have the functionality to detect multiple languages.\nFor eg:\nimport sys\n{% for tony in avengers %}\n  {% for thanos in enemy %}\n                    print(\"Thanos Rocks!!\")\n          print(\"Testing Indentation\")\n{% set avengers = loose %}\n  {% endfor %}{# for thanos in enemy #}\n{% endfor %}{# for tony in avengers #}\n\nAfter the indentation, it would look like\nimport sys\n{% for tony in avengers %}\n  {% for thanos in enemy %}\n                   print(\"Thanos Rocks!!\")\n          print(\"Testing Indentation\")\n     {% set avengers = loose %}\n  {% endfor %}{# for thanos in enemy #}\n{% endfor %}{# for tony in avengers #}\n\nAs you see above, we provide no indentation  to both the print statements. We just ignore them.","diffHunk":null,"author":{"login":"Naveenaidu","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/30195193?v=4","name":"Naveen Naidu"},"createdAt":"2019-02-04T18:25:08Z","lastEditedAt":"2019-05-25T08:43:17Z","updatedAt":"2019-05-25T08:43:17Z"}]}}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala-bears","updatedAtMs":1556956007000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/pull/2724","number":2724,"title":"Changed links","body":"For short term contributors: we understand that getting your commits well\ndefined like we require is a hard task and takes some learning.

I don't know why people built a custom parser and configuration format instead of using a standard one, but maybe there is some reason.\nWhen coala started out, the syntax did not require custom sub level parsing, so INI style config was good and sufficient.\nBut when we started to implement aspects we had to face with tough task of custom sub level parsing. This makes LineParser and ConfParser more complex and error prone.  coala/coala#4511.  Now it would be nice to have a config system where we would not be limited by its complexity.  It would be much more comfortable if we can focus on implementation of a feature and worry less about how to make the parser accommodate the feature.\nThere will be many edge cases in integrating the TOML format .\nThe only challenge is to define the mapping between current coafile syntax and TOML syntax.\nbears = SpaceConsistencyBear, LineLengthBear can be easily mapped to bears = [ \"SpaceConsistencyBear\", \"LineLengthBear\" ].\nBut what does files += app.py  map into in TOML ? This has to be decided by the community. What syntax would they like ? No matter what syntax they may like, it can be easily implemented in TOML.\nOther challenge is that TOML parser does not load comments. There is an existing issue to solve this.\nwrite down what will break\nAccording to my current plan, absolutely nothing shall break down. I shall not be altering/interfering any existing functionality.  I will add classes like TomlConfWriter , TomlConfParser  etc, but not break/alter anything.\nThe project flows from configuration to processing to actions. I shall not have to worry about anything that comes after configuration like processing and actions. This is due to the fact that after configuration gathering code provides sections to processing, it goes out of focus. Now I shall create a system that will convert TOML file into sections. So I will not be interfering with the existing parsers and writers of coafile as well . This way I shall not touch the exiting configuration system as well. Essentially no existing parts are modified. The existing Section and Settings class will be used as they are without changing them.\n\nI have written a very detailed plan in https://github.com/PrajwalM2212/Coala-GSoC-Plan.\nI have read the codebase and made a implementation guide.
