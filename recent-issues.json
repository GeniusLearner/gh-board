The only option seems to follow is use custom contract type eg.\nnew_contract('valid_name', lambda s: isinstance(s, str) and len(s)>0)\n@contract(names='dict(int: (valid_name, int))')\ndef process_accounting(records):\n    ...\n\nThe problem occurring over here is the function name provided to the new_contract method gets the value of the argument implicitly as the one and only argument. Since this doesn't even receive the self or any other kind of variable its impossible to access other objects from inside this method which means we can't populate a class for storing metadata of the acceptable set of values and unless we modify contracts itself or define the acceptable set of values in the function itself. When defining the acceptable values in the function itself it is impossible to access those values outside the method thus defeating the purpose. contracts also follows a strict syntax which makes it impossible to predefine a custom set of methods for each kind of setting in the base classes to which the actual bear can just pass the acceptable values and the setting list to compare against. Everything needs to be implemented in each bear itself. Summing up things like\n[new_contract(i, lambda s: isinstance(s, str) and len(s)>0) for i in in setting_list]\n\nalso doesn't work which makes the code much more difficult to read. The usage of contracts module also provides difficulty when the some default values of the bear setting are assumed in case of the value to the setting is not provided or invalid value is given.\nUsing Type hints provided by python\nThese are pretty much worthless. They can be only used for documentation purposes unless the type checking is performed specially with loading the mypy module which just checks for type hint inconsistencies and doesn't actually run the program. (Haven't tested this out with custom classes). Normal runs of the code don't point out any inconsistencies in invalid types according to type hints.\nWriting code and manual checks for each setting in some way or the other\nThis should be the last resort unless an elegant way is devised. Can be done using decorators or the bear code is itself but a common set of classnames have to be come upon which will be used by all the bears to extract out information about these settings. This can be performed by adding classes to the base class and asking the bear writers to fill them up. Functions can also be made in the base classes to test out settings to automatically provide just the setting and the default values, calling the correct function for the correct setting type and checking whether the value provided is valid or not.","comments":16,"createdAt":"2018-06-10T06:59:58Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-11T05:42:56Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"ishanSrt","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/29859362?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"ishanSrt","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/29859362?v=4"},"labels":[]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala-bears","updatedAtMs":1534394227000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/issues/2304","number":2304,"title":"GitCommitBearTest.py : Typo in line 50","body":"There's a typo at https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/blob/master/tests/vcs/git/GitCommitBearTest.py#L50\nmessgae -> message","comments":5,"createdAt":"2018-03-03T17:52:58Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-16T04:37:07Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"virresh","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10978108?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"virresh","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10978108?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"codeKAMAT","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/36402247?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"area/documentation","color":"c5def5"},{"name":"difficulty/newcomer","color":"65C8FF"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala-bears","updatedAtMs":1532640887000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/issues/2437","number":2437,"title":"PEP8Bear: Change the docstring indentation.","body":"difficulty/newcomer","comments":10,"createdAt":"2018-04-15T06:38:39Z","updatedAt":"2018-07-26T21:34:47Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"newbazz","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/25884863?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"newbazz","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/25884863?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"vaibhav9619","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/35555074?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"area/documentation","color":"c5def5"},{"name":"difficulty/newcomer","color":"65C8FF"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala-bears","updatedAtMs":1535169338000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/issues/2453","number":2453,"title":"CIRCLE_NODE_INDEX hack for travis is not required anymore","body":".travis.yml sets CIRCLE_NODE_INDEX=-1 to avoid being a circle worker\nRemove code related to this hack as pip deps are no more called from travis","comments":3,"createdAt":"2018-04-26T16:47:58Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-25T03:55:38Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"harshhx17","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/31805694?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"harshhx17","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/31805694?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"area/ci","color":"d93f0b"},{"name":"difficulty/newcomer","color":"65C8FF"},{"name":"importance/low","color":"70e870"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala-bears","updatedAtMs":1534436530000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/issues/2062","number":2062,"title":"JSONFormatBear complains about number representation","body":"Let's say I have a file test.json for a simulation I'm running,\n{\n    \"expansion-coefficient\": 23.4e-6\n}\nNow, when I run coala -b JSONFormatBear --files=test.json, it wants to change the number to 2.34e-05, which is of course mathematically equivalent.

specified upstream URL.  This would also help with license checks, as a list of all upstream resources would be kept.

These should be added in the second phase.\nThen the third phase of the project is to add two more non-git scm, such as fossil and launchpad.","comments":1,"createdAt":"2018-06-04T09:55:20Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-01T02:22:22Z","closedAt":"2018-08-01T02:22:22Z","state":"closed","user":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"guyzmo","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/254441?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"Project Proposal","color":"f9d0c4"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"projects","updatedAtMs":1533284765000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/projects/issues/597","number":597,"title":"Windows bears","body":"There are many bears which are not being tested on Windows, and very likely some which do not work on Windows and we dont know about it.\nThis project would bring our bears CI to 100% coverage, fixing all bugs in bears that are related to Windows.","comments":1,"createdAt":"2018-07-02T06:44:02Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-03T08:26:05Z","closedAt":"2018-08-03T08:26:05Z","state":"closed","user":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"Project Proposal","color":"f9d0c4"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"projects","updatedAtMs":1533990342000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/projects/issues/603","number":603,"title":"Proposal: Gitmate to submit patches when available from master builds","body":"If coala dependencies update, new fixes may be automatically available.\nThey may come from new versions of linter tools, new releases of bears, or new data used by old bears.\nThe most common case for coala is updates to our mobans repo which need to be rolled out to all repos.\nFor this we will need a MobanBear .\nThe mechanism for creating PRs is simple, but will require some improvements to IGitt.\nThe logic for how to do this sanely in a constantly moving repo with humans involved is harder and needs a careful design and more careful implementation.

The meat of this project is supporting lots of versions of Go, and different BSD, and possible also other more obscure OS like Alpine Linux.\nThe current repology project is about getting 'all' linters linked to Repology.\nI suspect the timeline is not allowing enough time for the process of creating Repology packages for linters that are not yet in Repology, and it seems large numbers of them are missing.  So this will take quite a bit longer than planned.  We'll need to look at various methods of automating the process.  Maybe we rename it to be the 'repology metadata' project.  It will still need to include implementation of the installation routines, but it probably wont have time to solve installation of every bear.  Perhaps it should focus only on linters managed via ruby bundler, and or npm.

I am surprised that there are no forks which have modified this (c.f. #5), as that seems like a logical easy way to improve the front page (c.f. #3).\nIncluding configuration in the master branch causes forks to diverge.

Improved I/O mechanism for coala.\n+   1. Added a class `FileFactory` to interface with files and to provide file\n+      contents in different forms like string, binary data or as a tuple.\n+   2. Added a `Directory` class to interface with directories and provide\n+      useful information about them such as the directory path, parent\n+      directory and timestamps. This will be later used to implement ignore\n+      directories functionality.\n+   3. Added documentation for `FileFactory` and improved the NextGen-Core\n+      docs.\n+\n+2. Caching support.\n+   1. Cached the properties of `FileFactory` which turned out to be a\n+      significant performance boost in consecutive coala runs.\n+   2. Added support for unordered collection types in `persistent_hash`\n+      which improved the NextGen-Core's ability to hash much more\n+      complex task objects (which are used in NextGen caching).\n+\n+3. Integrated `FileFactory` with the core.\n+   1. Added line endings support for `FileFactory`.\n+   2. Implemented a middleware `FileDict` that mimics a dictionary\n+      and provides the bears in the old core with the actual file\n+      contents instead of the `FileFactory` objects thereby maintaining\n+      backwards compatibility with the old core.\n+   3. Modified the tests to use actual files and the `FileFactory` objects\n+      instead of hard-coded file contents.\n+\n+#### Challenges\n+\n+One of the first challenges I faced was designing the `FileFactory`.\n+But with my mentors help we were able to come up with a design that\n+could be used for the NextGen-Core and also maintained compatibility\n+with the old core.\n+\n+The biggest challenge that I faced these three months for the integration\n+of the aforementioned `FileFactory` with the core. Initially about thirty\n+tests were failing but after discussing the idea of using a middleware\n+(`FileDict`) to maintain backwards compatibilty with the old core the test\n+failures were significantly reduced to just six.

It includes adding settings to inspect special git commits like\n+`git merge`, `git revert` and commits that disable CI builds. These commits\n+are used only under specific conditions and when certain requirements are met.\n+With the implementation of these new bears, projects can easily configure\n+the `.coafile` to manage such commits according to their requirements.\n+\n+#### Work Done\n+\n+<br>\n+\n+1.)

For GSoC, I worked on\n+  [coala-pyflakes](https://gitlab.com/coala/bears/coala-pyflakes) and\n+  [pyflakes](https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes). The project was to\n+  integrate pyflakes-enhanced AST into coala as a metabear which was\n+  then used to develop various plugins. The second part of the project\n+  was to write plugin bears using the developed `PyFlakesASTBear`.\n+\n+social:\n+  - GitHub:\n+    - username: macbox7\n+    - link: https://github.com/macbox7\n+  -

I chose coala for my GSoC project\n+  because I think it's awesome to be able to push my friends a friendly reminder\n+  to indent their code properly, and programmatically detect when they went lazy\n+  in doing so, which helps me to focus on the main logic when working on a team\n+  project.\n+social:\n+  - GitHub:\n+    - username: virresh\n+    - link: https://github.com/virresh\n+  - GitLab:\n+    - username: virresh\n+    - link: https://gitlab.com/virresh\n+  - Gitter:\n+    - username: virresh\n+    - link: https://gitter.im/virresh\n+  - Openhub:\n+    - username: virresh\n+    - link: https://www.openhub.net/accounts/virresh\n+email: viresh16118@iiitd.ac.in\n+blog: https://virresh.wordpress.com/\n+activity:\n+  - 1:\n+      - repo: cEPs\n+      - link: https://github.com/coala/cEPs/commit/49c6cec2\n+      - details: >\n+          \"cEP-0018: Integration of ANTLR in coala\"\n+  - 2:\n+      - repo: cEPs\n+      - link: https://github.com/coala/cEPs/commit/b8a17299\n+      - details: >\n+          \"cEP-0018.md: Add information about fixes\"\n+  - 3:\n+      - repo: coala-antlr\n+      - link: https://gitlab.com/coala/bears/coala-antlr/commit/f51addcf\n+      - details: >\n+          \"Initial Commit\"","author":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4","name":"John Vandenberg"},"reactions":[],"createdAt":"2018-08-13T07:20:49Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-08-13T07:20:49Z"},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMTk5NTAyNg==","url":"https://github.com/coala/projects/pull/617#issuecomment-411995026","bodyText":"https://deploy-preview-617--coala-projects.netlify.com/gsoc/2018/statusreport/virresh","diffHunk":null,"author":{"login":"virresh","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10978108?v=4","name":"Viresh Gupta"},"reactions":[],"createdAt":"2018-08-10T07:04:47Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-08-10T07:04:47Z"}]}}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"projects","updatedAtMs":1534044581000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/projects/pull/618","number":618,"title":"reports: Add li-boxuan's GSoC report","body":"https://deploy-preview-618--coala-projects.netlify.com/gsoc/2018/statusreport/li-boxuan","comments":18,"createdAt":"2018-08-10T15:10:22Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-12T03:29:41Z","closedAt":"2018-08-12T03:28:16Z","state":"merged","user":{"login":"li-boxuan","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/25746010?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"li-boxuan","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/25746010?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"process/pending review","color":"bfe5bf"},{"name":"size/M","color":"ededed"}],"pullRequest":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/projects/pull/618","comments":[{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDIwOTM5NjYxNw==","url":"https://github.com/coala/projects/pull/618#discussion_r209396617","bodyText":"I think you have to add a report_year variable as well","diffHunk":"@@ -0,0 +1,356 @@\n+---\n+layout: report\n+permalink: /GSoC/2018/StatusReport/li-boxuan","author":{"login":"hemangsk","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/13018570?v=4","name":"Hemang Kumar"},"reactions":[{"id":"MDg6UmVhY3Rpb24yNzc4MzA3Mw==","createdAt":"2018-08-11T04:31:24Z","content":"THUMBS_UP","user":{"login":"li-boxuan","name":"Boxuan Li"}}],"createdAt":"2018-08-10T22:14:57Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-08-10T22:14:57Z"},{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDIwOTQxNzU5OQ==","url":"https://github.com/coala/projects/pull/618#discussion_r209417599","bodyText":"start at 1\nalso this is yaml, which has two space indents","diffHunk":"@@ -0,0 +1,357 @@\n+---\n+layout: report\n+permalink: /GSoC/2018/StatusReport/li-boxuan\n+student: Boxuan Li\n+organisation: coala\n+organisation_link : https://coala.io\n+report_year: 2018\n+project: Meta-review\n+project_link: https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5188493739819008\n+tarball: https://github.com/li-boxuan/GSoCReport/raw/master/li-boxuan_coala.tar\n+mentors: >\n+ [Hemang Kumar](https://github.com/hemangsk/) &\n+ [Surya Widi](https://github.com/blazeu) &\n+ [Andrew Dassonville](https://github.com/andrewda)\n+phase:\n+ - Bonding : https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/GSoC-2018/milestones/14\n+ - Phase 1 : https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/GSoC-2018/milestones/15\n+ - Phase 2 : https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/GSoC-2018/milestones/16\n+ - Phase 3 : https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/GSoC-2018/milestones/17\n+bio: >\n+  I am a final year student (expected graduation date: May 2019) of Computer\n+  Science at The University of Hong Kong.

details: >\n+     Generate a fake api similar to coala's webservices\n+\n+### Newcomer Metrics and Gamification\n+\n+This project is about automating the recognition of activities performed by people\n+who join the coala community, and encourage them to progress towards obtaining the\n+role of \"Developer\" in the community.\n+\n+This project incorporated a gamification system which allows us to track the progress\n+of newcomers activities and assign some points to each of the activities they do.\n+The newcomers will get some score which will be the sum of all the points they have\n+earned by performing several activities. The score they get will be a deciding factor\n+for the current 'Level' of the newcomer and the activities they perform will be a\n+deciding factor for 'Badges' they have earned.\n+\n+coala always tries to be a welcoming organization for newcomers, giving them clear\n+pathways and as much direct assistance as possible. However, it is already known that\n+newcomers face many barriers while attempting to contribute to open source for the\n+first time, and additional barriers while attempting to contribute to projects run\n+by the coala organization. On the other hand, gamification is widely used to engage\n+and motivate people to accomplish tasks and improve their performance.\n+\n+Thus, the goal of this project is to use gamification to orient and motivate newcomers\n+to overcome onboarding barriers to contribute and engage with coala and its community.\n+\n+#### Work Done\n+\n+##### Creating the APIs\n+\n+To build the gamification app, there was a need of constant data supply of all the\n+activities newcomers do, i.e. Getting a pull request merge, Creating an issue and\n+sending messages to the gitter channels. The work to achieve the same has been done\n+in the [webservices](https://gitlab.com/coala/landing/) repo.

details: >\n+     Generate a fake api similar to coala's webservices\n+\n+### Newcomer Metrics and Gamification\n+\n+This project is about automating the recognition of activities performed by people\n+who join the coala community, and encourage them to progress towards obtaining the\n+role of \"Developer\" in the community.\n+\n+This project incorporated a gamification system which allows us to track the progress\n+of newcomers activities and assign some points to each of the activities they do.\n+The newcomers will get some score which will be the sum of all the points they have\n+earned by performing several activities. The score they get will be a deciding factor\n+for the current 'Level' of the newcomer and the activities they perform will be a\n+deciding factor for 'Badges' they have earned.\n+\n+coala always tries to be a welcoming organization for newcomers, giving them clear\n+pathways and as much direct assistance as possible. However, it is already known that\n+newcomers face many barriers while attempting to contribute to open source for the\n+first time, and additional barriers while attempting to contribute to projects run\n+by the coala organization. On the other hand, gamification is widely used to engage\n+and motivate people to accomplish tasks and improve their performance.\n+\n+Thus, the goal of this project is to use gamification to orient and motivate newcomers\n+to overcome onboarding barriers to contribute and engage with coala and its community.\n+\n+#### Work Done\n+\n+##### Creating the APIs\n+\n+To build the gamification app, there was a need of constant data supply of all the\n+activities newcomers do, i.e. Getting a pull request merge, Creating an issue and\n+sending messages to the gitter channels. The work to achieve the same has been done\n+in the [webservices](https://gitlab.com/coala/landing/) repo. And the output of all\n+the script can be viewed at [webservices.coala.io](https://github.com/sks444/webservices.coala.io/commit/9d263725092f2ab18fde84fb46dececc95d2a76d) which is a workaround to get a fixed\n+URL for all the APIs until there is the integration of continuous deployment in the webservices.\n+\n+##### Building the Gamification system\n+\n+The second and the important part of my work, from [importing the useful newcomers data](https://github.com/coala/community/commit/537602ecbe67263a1c3a877f88444ec6620190f4)","author":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4","name":"John Vandenberg"},"reactions":[],"createdAt":"2018-08-11T11:12:29Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-08-11T11:12:29Z"},{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDIwOTQyNDI4Mw==","url":"https://github.com/coala/projects/pull/619#discussion_r209424283","bodyText":"80cpl","diffHunk":"@@ -0,0 +1,246 @@\n+---\n+layout: report\n+permalink: /GSoC/2018/StatusReport/ShrikrishnaSingh\n+student: Shrikrishna Singh\n+organisation: coala\n+organisation_link : https://coala.io\n+project: Newcomer metrics and gamification\n+project_link: https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5892040252981248\n+tarball: https://github.com/sks444/GSoC-18-Patches/raw/master/project.tar.gz\n+mentors: >\n+ [John Vandenberg](http://github.com/jayvdb),\n+ [Pranav Dixit](https://github.com/prnvdixit),\n+ [Andrew Dassonville](https://github.com/andrewda) &\n+ [Gopala](https://github.com/gkrishnan724)\n+phase:\n+ - Bonding : <https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/GSoC-2018/milestones/2>\n+ - Phase 1 : <https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/GSoC-2018/milestones/19>\n+ - Phase 2 : <https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/GSoC-2018/milestones/43>\n+ - Phase 3 : <https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/GSoC-2018/milestones/44>\n+bio: >\n+ I am a final year Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate at\n+ Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University.

You will\nlikely receive a lot of bot comments and build failures if coala does not\npass on every single commit!\n\nAfter you submit your pull request, DO NOT click the 'Update Branch' button.\nWhen asked for a rebase, consult coala.io/rebase\ninstead.\nPlease consider helping us by reviewing other peoples pull requests as well:\n\npick up any PR at https://coala.io/review\nreview it (check https://coala.io/reviewing for more info)\nif you are sure that it needs work, use cobot mark wip <URL> to get it out\nof the review queue.\n\nThe more you review, the more your score will grow at coala.io and we will\nreview your PRs faster!","comments":48,"createdAt":"2018-07-09T13:11:40Z","updatedAt":"2018-07-30T16:12:42Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"kriti21","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19872082?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"kriti21","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19872082?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"size/XS","color":"ededed"},{"name":"status/blocked","color":"e56994"}],"pullRequest":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/projects/pull/600","comments":[{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDIwMTAwMjQ5Mg==","url":"https://github.com/coala/projects/pull/600#discussion_r201002492","bodyText":"This doesnt need to be moved.

I also implemented a assign request plugin to assign\n+ issues to a user if he/she satisfies defined eligibilty conditions.\n+social:\n+ - GitHub:\n+   - username: Vamshi99\n+   - link: https://github.com/Vamshi99\n+ - GitLab:\n+   - username: Vamshi99\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/Vamshi99\n+ - Gitter:\n+   - username: Vamshi99\n+   - link: https://gitter.im/Vamshi99\n+email: bommvams72@gmail.com\n+blog: https://vamshi99.blogspot.com\n+activity:\n+ - 0:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/commit/225a88e695794535f50996b4997466b72e9d47ea\n+   - details: >\n+      Add gitmate pr rejector plugin\n+ - 2:\n+   - repo: IGitt\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/IGitt/commit/847afeb5460ce2866ecb2cc38593c0c486aa0271\n+   - details: >\n+      Commit.py: Add mentioned_issues, closes_issues propeties\n+ - 3:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/commit/05062b4f9758068291445f87469e4d9d2a4f9707\n+   - details: >\n+      Upgrade IGitt\n+ - 4:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/commit/3d2164d71722e55a6432a8911149c64897851564\n+   - details: >\n+      Add Fixes vs Closes automated checking plugin\n+ - 5:\n+   - repo: IGitt\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/IGitt/commit/4a044453f5d34c9f1b8227b7f57b8a0fd0caba57\n+   - details: >\n+      MergeRequest.py: Add fix_issues, close_issues, resolve_issues properties\n+ - 6:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/commit/ffd554de617d619809f11b0284eaa032c2d9df83\n+   - details: >\n+      Auto assign issue based on commit mention in PR\n+ - 7:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/commit/0eec2ec32e7afd7d017cad4c67a741c688e1bfc4\n+   - details: >\n+      apps.py: Add helper function to fetch plugin settings\n+ - 8:\n+   - repo: IGitt\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/IGitt/commit/e2224d7d1f61a34065f741535e53e676dc51ff4b\n+   - details: >\n+      Add Team class\n+ - 9:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/commit/f9d08c9a88c0b958a4c2ec5eb813fcd124b5300e\n+   - details: >\n+      Mark PR as WIP if coala plugin detects errors\n+ - 10:\n+   - repo: IGitt\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/IGitt/commit/c4abdd4f9367af8ce73f39f525383def68de6b62\n+   - details: >\n+      MergeRequest: Add mergeable property\n+ - 11:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/commit/db76142d3ecb1e6cd9cd10885ae2475cb07c4d3d\n+   - details: >\n+      Notify merge conflicts in a PR\n+ - 12:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/commit/ad5480c9b0a124d98020a4ad3fd3caf20fa1e321\n+   - details: >\n+      pr_rejector: Support regex in branch names\n+ - 13:\n+   - repo: IGitt\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/IGitt/commit/94735ff0f1024d6f293db90516087d8e4d2c353d\n+   - details: >\n+      Organization: Add issues property and filter_issues method\n+ - 14:\n+   - repo: IGitt\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/IGitt/commit/fff0d568f1f2731c5055995ff19bbc93be842d5f\n+   - details: >\n+      Repository: Filter issues by label, assignee\n+ - 15:\n+   - repo: IGitt\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/IGitt/commit/c025311167b07da5e825433a4d4d5e376adfed62\n+   - details: >\n+      GitLabUser: Fetch user id from username\n+ - 16:\n+   - repo: mr-rebaser\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/mr-rebaser/commit/fad8305823a1058e93cd2397b5239a882b66c3f9\n+   - details: >\n+      Add squash pull request command\n+ - 17:\n+   - repo: mr-rebaser\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/mr-rebaser/commit/3124c07ca5cd46acf985dc25fe22889e5a4744d0\n+   - details: >\n+      Dockerfile: Install requirements\n+ - 18:\n+   - repo: mr-rebaser\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/mr-rebaser/commit/68360f3f0fac686907c7eb44c1a70bfa9e276d42\n+   - details: >\n+      run.py: Update squash command\n+ - 19:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/commit/dda98a8ab67d01376d3199bb82260838cebab7b0\n+   - details: >\n+      rebaser: Add squash command\n+---\n+\n+### Implement Gitmate automations and plugins for coala\n+\n+#### Work Done\n+\n+1.

I also implemented a assign request plugin to assign\n+ issues to a user if he/she satisfies defined eligibilty conditions.\n+social:\n+ - GitHub:\n+   - username: Vamshi99\n+   - link: https://github.com/Vamshi99\n+ - GitLab:\n+   - username: Vamshi99\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/Vamshi99\n+ - Gitter:\n+   - username: Vamshi99\n+   - link: https://gitter.im/Vamshi99\n+email: bommvams72@gmail.com\n+blog: https://vamshi99.blogspot.com\n+activity:\n+ - 0:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/commit/225a88e695794535f50996b4997466b72e9d47ea\n+   - details: >\n+      Add gitmate pr rejector plugin\n+ - 2:\n+   - repo: IGitt\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/IGitt/commit/847afeb5460ce2866ecb2cc38593c0c486aa0271\n+   - details: >\n+      Commit.py: Add mentioned_issues, closes_issues propeties\n+ - 3:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/commit/05062b4f9758068291445f87469e4d9d2a4f9707\n+   - details: >\n+      Upgrade IGitt\n+ - 4:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/commit/3d2164d71722e55a6432a8911149c64897851564\n+   - details: >\n+      Add Fixes vs Closes automated checking plugin\n+ - 5:\n+   - repo: IGitt\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/IGitt/commit/4a044453f5d34c9f1b8227b7f57b8a0fd0caba57\n+   - details: >\n+      MergeRequest.py: Add fix_issues, close_issues, resolve_issues properties\n+ - 6:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/commit/ffd554de617d619809f11b0284eaa032c2d9df83\n+   - details: >\n+      Auto assign issue based on commit mention in PR\n+ - 7:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/commit/0eec2ec32e7afd7d017cad4c67a741c688e1bfc4\n+   - details: >\n+      apps.py: Add helper function to fetch plugin settings\n+ - 8:\n+   - repo: IGitt\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/IGitt/commit/e2224d7d1f61a34065f741535e53e676dc51ff4b\n+   - details: >\n+      Add Team class\n+ - 9:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/commit/f9d08c9a88c0b958a4c2ec5eb813fcd124b5300e\n+   - details: >\n+      Mark PR as WIP if coala plugin detects errors\n+ - 10:\n+   - repo: IGitt\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/IGitt/commit/c4abdd4f9367af8ce73f39f525383def68de6b62\n+   - details: >\n+      MergeRequest: Add mergeable property\n+ - 11:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/commit/db76142d3ecb1e6cd9cd10885ae2475cb07c4d3d\n+   - details: >\n+      Notify merge conflicts in a PR\n+ - 12:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/commit/ad5480c9b0a124d98020a4ad3fd3caf20fa1e321\n+   - details: >\n+      pr_rejector: Support regex in branch names\n+ - 13:\n+   - repo: IGitt\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/IGitt/commit/94735ff0f1024d6f293db90516087d8e4d2c353d\n+   - details: >\n+      Organization: Add issues property and filter_issues method\n+ - 14:\n+   - repo: IGitt\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/IGitt/commit/fff0d568f1f2731c5055995ff19bbc93be842d5f\n+   - details: >\n+      Repository: Filter issues by label, assignee\n+ - 15:\n+   - repo: IGitt\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/IGitt/commit/c025311167b07da5e825433a4d4d5e376adfed62\n+   - details: >\n+      GitLabUser: Fetch user id from username\n+ - 16:\n+   - repo: mr-rebaser\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/mr-rebaser/commit/fad8305823a1058e93cd2397b5239a882b66c3f9\n+   - details: >\n+      Add squash pull request command\n+ - 17:\n+   - repo: mr-rebaser\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/mr-rebaser/commit/3124c07ca5cd46acf985dc25fe22889e5a4744d0\n+   - details: >\n+      Dockerfile: Install requirements\n+ - 18:\n+   - repo: mr-rebaser\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/mr-rebaser/commit/68360f3f0fac686907c7eb44c1a70bfa9e276d42\n+   - details: >\n+      run.py: Update squash command\n+ - 19:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/commit/dda98a8ab67d01376d3199bb82260838cebab7b0\n+   - details: >\n+      rebaser: Add squash command\n+ - 20:\n+   - repo: IGitt\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/IGitt/commit/f4ec3c602745bcf08405479a684876cc1080a21f\n+   - details: >\n+      Issue: Add available_assignees property\n+ - 21:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/merge_requests/525\n+   - details: >\n+      Add assign request command\n+ - 22:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/merge_requests/524\n+   - details: >\n+      Add review plugin\n+---\n+\n+### Implement Gitmate automations and plugins for coala\n+\n+#### Work Done\n+\n+1.

Pdb's quit-command (`q`) remapped so coala continues its normal execution\n+      without aborting. So, `quit` or `q` will first clear all breakpoints and\n+      then continue execution.\n+   3. Users can specify the bear they want to debug using `--debug-bears`.\n+   4. Users can specify to debug bears using a `.coafile`.\n+\n+2.

Debugger Interface added in coala.\n+   1. Step into the `run()` method of a bear move through it using a debugger\n+      interface such as `pdb` and exits as soon as `run()` is left.\n+   2. Pdb's quit-command (`q`) remapped so coala continues its normal execution\n+      without aborting. So, `quit` or `q` will first clear all breakpoints and\n+      then continue execution.\n+   3. Users can specify the bear they want to debug using `--debug-bears`.\n+   4. Users can specify to debug bears using a `.coafile`.\n+\n+2. A new command `settings` is included in coala's Debugging Interface to\n+   inspect Bear settings in the debugging environment. It displays all passed\n+   settings of a Bear and their values so bear developer can quickly inspect\n+   them.\n+\n+3. Profiler Interface added in coala.\n+   1. The profiler will start by profiling the `run()` method of bears because\n+      this is the part where bear writers will spend time on, as rest of the\n+      part like loading the files, collecting the settings, etc. are done by\n+      coala itself.\n+   2. `--profile-bears` or `profile_bears` (using .coafile) is the main argument\n+      to enable profiling.\n+   3. Accept an additional parameter `directory_path` through which bear\n+      developers can specify where to store the profiled data files.\n+\n+#### Challenges\n+\n+I had difficulties with testing of Debugger interface. With the help of `Mock`,\n+test for debugger interface was created, though code coverage was 100% but\n+`mock` test was not the ideal test, so after hours of discussion with Mischa we\n+decided to capture the `pdb stdout` and assert the the output with the real\n+output but problem arised, the ideal tests passes but somehow it didn't showed\n+the code coverage to 100% not only that it was also removing the coverage of\n+the previous tests, at first I thought created test have some problem but seems\n+like `pytest-cov` had a problem, so to confirm that I created a\n+[test repo](https://github.com/RaiVaibhav/test_repo) and enable the\n+[CI](https://travis-ci.org/RaiVaibhav/test_repo) on that repo to check the\n+coverage response, it also showed same failure. So, we first created a issue on\n+`pytest-cov` repo, but actual problem was both coverage and debugger use the\n+same trace feature, so it was not possible to run coverage and debugger in\n+parallel or say it is not possible to chain the trace functions, so Mischa gave\n+a idea to restore the trace callbacks and then run test and finally it worked\n+so I included both ideal and `Mock` test so that the coverage remain 100, but\n+in all of these I lagged 3-4 week from my schedule.

Debugger Interface added in coala.\n+   1. Step into the `run()` method of a bear move through it using a debugger\n+      interface such as `pdb` and exits as soon as `run()` is left.\n+   2. Pdb's quit-command (`q`) remapped so coala continues its normal execution\n+      without aborting. So, `quit` or `q` will first clear all breakpoints and\n+      then continue execution.\n+   3. Users can specify the bear they want to debug using `--debug-bears`.\n+   4. Users can specify to debug bears using a `.coafile`.\n+\n+2. A new command `settings` is included in coala's Debugging Interface to\n+   inspect Bear settings in the debugging environment. It displays all passed\n+   settings of a Bear and their values so bear developer can quickly inspect\n+   them.\n+\n+3. Profiler Interface added in coala.\n+   1. The profiler will start by profiling the `run()` method of bears because\n+      this is the part where bear writers will spend time on, as rest of the\n+      part like loading the files, collecting the settings, etc. are done by\n+      coala itself.\n+   2. `--profile-bears` or `profile_bears` (using .coafile) is the main argument\n+      to enable profiling.\n+   3. Accept an additional parameter `directory_path` through which bear\n+      developers can specify where to store the profiled data files.\n+\n+#### Challenges\n+\n+I had difficulties with testing of Debugger interface. With the help of `Mock`,\n+test for debugger interface was created, though code coverage was 100% but\n+`mock` test was not the ideal test, so after hours of discussion with Mischa we\n+decided to capture the `pdb stdout` and assert the the output with the real\n+output but problem arised, the ideal tests passes but somehow it didn't showed\n+the code coverage to 100% not only that it also removed the coverage of the\n+previous tests, at first I thought created test have some problem but seems\n+like `pytest-cov` had a problem, so to confirm that I created a\n+[test repo](https://github.com/RaiVaibhav/test_repo) and enable the\n+[CI](https://travis-ci.org/RaiVaibhav/test_repo) on that repo to check the\n+coverage report, it also showed same failure. So, I created a issue on\n+`pytest-cov` repo but actual problem was, both coverage and debugger use the\n+same trace feature, so it was not possible to run coverage and debugger in\n+parallel or say it is not possible to chain the trace functions, so Mischa gave\n+a idea to restore the trace callbacks and then run test, it worked finally so I\n+included both ideal and `Mock` test so that the coverage remain 100, but in all\n+of these I lagged around 3 week from my schedule. So I couldn't implement one of\n+the proposed feature.\n+\n+#### Work to be done\n+\n+A tool which will provide the ability to inspect result instances like\n+`origin`, `diffs`, `file`, `severity`, `message`, `aspects` and several other\n+attributes in debugging environment or in a seperate python console where all\n+where user can easily access there values.

Also, I think there is justification to do so: we shouldn't run coala on files generated by .ci/build.sh IMO.","diffHunk":"@@ -22,9 +22,9 @@ before_install:\n   - npm i -g jshint\n \n script:\n+  - coala --non-interactive -V\n   - ./.ci/build.sh\n   - rm -rf private/\n-  - coala --non-interactive -V","author":{"login":"li-boxuan","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/25746010?v=4","name":"Boxuan Li"},"reactions":[],"createdAt":"2018-06-07T14:43:13Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-06-07T14:43:13Z"},{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDE5Mzc3Nzk2NA==","url":"https://github.com/coala/community/pull/143#discussion_r193777964","bodyText":"I think it's worth adding a comment with a link to the issue, or just explain it in the commit.","diffHunk":"@@ -22,9 +22,9 @@ before_install:\n   - npm i -g jshint\n \n script:\n+  - coala --non-interactive -V\n   - ./.ci/build.sh\n   - rm -rf private/\n-  - coala --non-interactive -V","author":{"login":"blazeu","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1438859?v=4","name":"Surya Widi"},"reactions":[{"id":"MDg6UmVhY3Rpb24yNDc2Mzk5NA==","createdAt":"2018-06-07T14:57:09Z","content":"HOORAY","user":{"login":"li-boxuan","name":"Boxuan Li"}}],"createdAt":"2018-06-07T14:56:29Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-06-07T14:56:29Z"},{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDE5NDIxMzg5OA==","url":"https://github.com/coala/community/pull/143#discussion_r194213898","bodyText":"separate std libs and custom packages; and do some reordering, see other apps for example.","diffHunk":"@@ -0,0 +1,667 @@\n+import requests\n+from requests.exceptions import ReadTimeout\n+import json\n+import logging","author":{"login":"sks444","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/22263040?v=4","name":"Shrikrishna Singh"},"reactions":[{"id":"MDg6UmVhY3Rpb24yNDg0OTg5Mg==","createdAt":"2018-06-09T05:39:51Z","content":"THUMBS_UP","user":{"login":"li-boxuan","name":"Boxuan Li"}}],"createdAt":"2018-06-09T04:35:57Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-06-09T04:35:57Z"},{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDE5NDIxMzkwMw==","url":"https://github.com/coala/community/pull/143#discussion_r194213903","bodyText":"extra line not required.","diffHunk":"@@ -0,0 +1,667 @@\n+import requests\n+from requests.exceptions import ReadTimeout\n+import json\n+import logging\n+from dateutil import parser\n+\n+from django.utils import timezone\n+\n+from community.git import get_org_name\n+","author":{"login":"sks444","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/22263040?v=4","name":"Shrikrishna Singh"},"reactions":[{"id":"MDg6UmVhY3Rpb24yNDg0OTg4MQ==","createdAt":"2018-06-09T05:38:52Z","content":"THUMBS_UP","user":{"login":"li-boxuan","name":"Boxuan Li"}}],"createdAt":"2018-06-09T04:36:24Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-06-09T04:36:24Z"},{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDE5NDIxMzk5Ng==","url":"https://github.com/coala/community/pull/143#discussion_r194213996","bodyText":"Use logging instead of print everywhere, see #9","diffHunk":"@@ -0,0 +1,667 @@\n+import requests\n+from requests.exceptions import ReadTimeout\n+import json\n+import logging\n+from dateutil import parser\n+\n+from django.utils import timezone\n+\n+from community.git import get_org_name\n+\n+from meta_review.models import Participant, Comment, Reaction\n+\n+\n+def parse_time(time):\n+    \"\"\"\n+    parse string to datetime\n+    :param time: a string represents time, e.g. 2018-05-09T11:19:26Z\n+    :return: an offset-aware datetime object\n+    \"\"\"\n+    if time is None:\n+        return None\n+\n+    return parser.parse(time)\n+\n+\n+class MetaReviewHandler:\n+    \"\"\"\n+    This is the class responsible for scraping provided information (reviews,\n+    reactions), processing them and dumping into Django database\n+    \"\"\"\n+\n+    def __init__(self, content, date):\n+        \"\"\"\n+        Constructs a new ``MetaReviewHandler``\n+\n+        :param content: Parsed JSON data\n+        :param date: The update date\n+        \"\"\"\n+        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n+        self.logger.info('this package is alive')\n+\n+        self.date = date\n+\n+        #

../outside_committers/, .../outside_projects/, ../portfolio_projects, one by one, to verify that there is not any problem in any of the views, and the netlify passes when any of them is removed.\n\n/model/openhub/portfolio_projects/ is prettier than /openhub/ , so I would prefer removing the latter.\n\nAt /openhub/ we are deploying only one page and at
