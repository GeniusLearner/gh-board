The override methods mostly just call the super() method, creating an extra performance degradation.\nThe only method which isnt just super() is __getitem__.  It contains a bug, because if the value in the dict has 0 lines, val is [] , and if val: will be false, and None is returned instead of [].  That is wildly different behaviour to previously, as None is not iterable.  It means all code (including global bears) needs to check whether the file is None before iterating over the file contents.  File contents being None was previously possible, but only when 'raw' mode was enabled.  A file with 0 lines is not the same as an unreadable / raw file.\nFileFactory was introduced in b06dfe4.  The most critical problem is that it is not a \"factory\".  Factories are an extremely important and very well established pattern covered in all OO books with buying ( https://www.oodesign.com/factory-pattern.html ), so to call this a factory is very confusing / misleading.\nIt was to be a wrapper for a \"file\" object, which was previously a list of str, where each item was a line of the file.  While a design goal was to hide some of the details, it still needs to be backwards compatible in order to avoid breaking existing code.  This is especially important at the moment given that the current status of coala is so bug ridden with many regressions that investigating bugs requires installing from old git commits more than a year to verify the old behaviour.\nTwo \"list\" unimplemented methods which were used by coala-quickstart are __len__ and __getitem__.  These missing methods need to be re-implemented.  If there is a good justification for deprecating them, that deprecation should be done properly.  For __len__, it seems unjustifiable to not provide this, as this single number can be cached and provides a lot of information, and is especially helpful if avoiding re-reading files which have been evicted from the cache, as a 0 line file can be more efficiently created in memory than re-reading from the disk.  __getitem__ is much easier to justify deprecating if the file contents are being evicted from the cache to reduce the memory footprint of coala.  That hasnt been implemented yet.","comments":0,"createdAt":"2018-10-13T18:57:47Z","updatedAt":"2018-10-13T18:57:47Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"labels":[]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala","updatedAtMs":1539458553000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/5812","number":5812,"title":"LocalBearTestHelper:

I believe that quote is a product of its time (1991), and that Coala can do better to be a welcoming project.\nWe should write maintainable code because we have respect for our peers and colleagues who will read and work with it, not because of threat of death. The quote is also unnecessarily gendered.\n\nApologies also for the drive-by PR 🙇 For some additional context, I became aware of this quote because I work with a lot of software development students, and saw a large number were contributors to Coala. Coala is doing an amazing job of being accessible to students and upcoming software developers, but this also makes it important to ensure that students who work on this project are being taught respect for their fellow humans 💖\n\nI've added [WIP] as currently this commit removes the quote entirely. It may be more suitable to find an alternative to fill that space and act as the one-line pitch. If anyone has suggestions, please feel free to add them!\n\nSome follow-up discussions can be found on that PR.

It should be ordered alphabetically (that's what JSONBear already offers), but also contains many objects in an array that are very small and should be kept on a single line:\n{\n    \"stuff\": {\n        \"itemA\": {\"value\": 33, \"doubled\": 66},\n        \"itemB\": {\"value\": 44, \"doubled\": 88},\n        \"itemC\": {\"value\": 55, \"doubled\": 110},\n        \"itemD\": {\"value\": 66, \"doubled\": 132}\n    }\n}\nSo each line indicates a new item. When expanded, this looks too bloated:\n{\n  \"stuff\": {\n    \"itemA\": {\n      \"value\": 33,\n      \"doubled\": 66\n    },\n    \"itemB\": {\n      \"value\": 44,\n      \"doubled\": 88\n    },\n    \"itemC\": {\n      \"value\": 55,\n      \"doubled\": 110\n    },\n    \"itemD\": {\n      \"value\": 66,\n      \"doubled\": 132\n    }\n  }\n}\nSo I want a setting that allows me to control this expansion to a certain depth. For esxample in my case, I want to define something like expand_level=1, which will only expand the first level of the top-object, so only \"stuff\".\nIt's maybe also worth to have finer graded control for this as well for specific items, so new settings where you can specify which items to expand and which not.\nBut this should be done in another issue, noting this here so we don't forget.","comments":1,"createdAt":"2018-05-23T07:45:15Z","updatedAt":"2018-09-28T10:44:24Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"Makman2","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6023916?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"Makman2","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6023916?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"area/genericbears","color":"D01975"},{"name":"area/newsettings","color":"006b75"},{"name":"difficulty/low","color":"207de5"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala-bears","updatedAtMs":1539278926000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/issues/2503","number":2503,"title":"JSONFormatBear: Message not appropriate when settings are omitted","body":"This file can be reformatted by sorting keys and following indentation.\n\nis always displayed, regardless whether you have actually enabled json_sort (to sort keys) or not.

data/cache version checking","body":"This was discussed briefly in #78, but I'll use this issue as a way to better express my ideas around the bigger problem here. Our data.(js|min.js|yml) files are going to be changing quite often while this site is in development, not just in their values but also in their keys.\nFor example, if we were to make some large changes to the data file. Let's say, for example, the desired effect of our change is to move the wikidata link of an organization to a new key:\n- \"wikidata_url\": \"//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q170855\"\n+ \"wikidata_link\": \"//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q170855\"\nWhen we deploy the code, it will still expect a \"wikidata_url\" key to exist, despite the name being changed to \"wikidata_link\". On top of that, the caching code will use the existing organization's object instead of making another API request to GCI (because we don't expect their returned data to change) so the \"wikidata_url\" will stick around along with the new \"wikidata_link\" leading to some very cluttered data.\nSo how do we fix this?\nPretty straight-forward. Adding a CACHE_VERSION or DATA_VERSION constant in our code and putting that value in our data.(js|min.js|yml) files will allow us to check if our data format is up to date. We would increment this version every time a breaking change is made to the data format (be it adding or removing a key, or updating the name of an existing key). If the DATA_VERSION we expect and the DATA_VERSION of the data file we're reading from don't match up, we ignore it and re-fetch all the data.","comments":1,"createdAt":"2017-12-14T03:53:42Z","updatedAt":"2018-09-20T12:00:22Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"andrewda","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/10191084?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"andrewda","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/10191084?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"difficulty/low","color":"59db91"},{"name":"status/STALE","color":"ededed"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"gci-leaders","updatedAtMs":1537444821000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/gci-leaders/issues/90","number":90,"title":"Stable JSON/YAML","body":"d278b4e contains a lot of unnecessary movement in the JSON/YAML, and some unreadable portions like coala & catrobat switching places.\nThe data should stay in the same order, to be VCS friendly.\nIf necessary, split the commits into\n\nchange data\nchange order","comments":2,"createdAt":"2017-12-18T02:33:37Z","updatedAt":"2018-09-20T12:00:21Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"difficulty/high","color":"a667f7"},{"name":"importance/low","color":"fcf1a6"},{"name":"status/STALE","color":"ededed"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"gci-leaders","updatedAtMs":1539265316000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/gci-leaders/issues/108","number":108,"title":"Add anchor for each org","body":"The block for each org should have an anchor\ne.g. https://gci-leaders.netlify.com/#coala should go directly to the coala section of the page","comments":5,"createdAt":"2017-12-22T01:00:09Z","updatedAt":"2018-10-11T13:41:56Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"pavankrishna13","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/32464579?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"difficulty/newcomer","color":"ffcce2"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"gci-leaders","updatedAtMs":1537444820000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/gci-leaders/issues/111","number":111,"title":"Use GraphQL API","body":"We should use GitHub's GraphQL API instead of the the REST API.

One way to do that is for  str(SourcePosition) to be implemented.\nAfter this initial PR, we can then also enhance ConfParser and allow Setting.origin to be given as a SourceRange to identify the precise start and end of each settings.  But that is later.  (You could do that in this PR if you wanted, but only it is easy to do.  Otherwise it is better to do this in stages.)\nThen the real fun begins when we consider section inheritance and +=, and even more funky when we consider #5532 .

I believe that quote is a product of its time (1991), and that Coala can do better to be a welcoming project.\nWe should write maintainable code because we have respect for our peers and colleagues who will read and work with it, not because of threat of death. The quote is also unnecessarily gendered.\nApologies also for the drive-by PR 🙇  For some additional context, I became aware of this quote because I work with a lot of software development students, and saw a large number were contributors to Coala. Coala is doing an amazing job of being accessible to students and upcoming software developers, but this also makes it important to ensure that students who work on this project are being taught respect for their fellow humans 💖\nI've added [WIP] as currently this commit removes the quote entirely. It may be more suitable to find an alternative to fill that space and act as the one-line pitch.

Even if your .coafile is something like below where your [cli] section is not present. It would help you to know that the [ cli ] section is generated automatically by Cliparser.py when you supply the arguments to coala. This section gets saved to your .coafile when you supply --save option.\n[python]\nfiles = admin.py\nbears = SpaceConsistencyBear, QuotesBear\nlanguage = Python\npreferred_quotation = '\n\ndefault_actions = **: ApplyPatchAction\n\nWhen i tried to debug it, section.contents always returns a Ordered dict of length 1 when the contents in the [ cli ] section is empty. I tried to print the value of section.contents when the [ cli ] section is empty. It's something like:-\nOrderedDict([('comment0', <Setting object(key='comment0', value='', origin='/home/theprophet/git/thepursuit/oth/.coafile', from_cli=False, to_append=False) at 0x7f5ed01aa1d0>)])\n\n\nFrom the above result I can positively say that section always maintains elements in its dictionary even when a section is empty.This is done so that the core of coala can properly identify it.\nThat's the reason, you checking if len(section.contents) == 0 will not work.Since this doesn't work your if condition fails and the message Executing Section CLI will always prompt up.\nI guess you need to change your approach.\nP.S:- Please test your changes locally before creating a PR.

I rarely used a [ cli ] section on my projects. I might be as well be wrong here 😅 . Better confirm it.\nIn any case, I guess this issue has two parts:-\n\n\nPrint Executing Section CLI only when the coala is provided with options. eg:-\ncoala --file = avenger.py --bears SpaceConsistencyBear, print the message Executing Section CLI when you execute this. But do not print it when you do the same operation using a .coafile.\nExecuting section cli gets printed even when we supply no arguments to coala.\nIf there was no [ cli ] section in the .coafile then this could be solved by a very small change in your present solution.\n\n\nCheck if there is a section named [ cli ] in the .coafile and check if its contents are empty (Do not use section.contents 😅). If so do not print the message. If it isn't empty then print it. But then again, this is a kinda broader issue.\n\n\nI mean if we are checking if the section[ cli ] is empty and then avoid printing the message Executing section cli if it is. Shouldn't we avoid printing the section beginning message  for all the sections that have no content in them in the .coafile. I don't know if that's the scope of the issue.

It was an honest mistake. But I don't think you need to close the PR for this.\n@rishabhgarg25699 As far as I think about there being another open PR by someone else. I don't think the other open PR can ever be considered. Though I appreciate his efforts for solving it.The other person has never claimed to be assigned to a task. Which I think is not correct approach. But on the other hand @Daronion did claim for the assignment of the issue before the other person if my knowledge serve me correctly. And then submitted a PR for it. I'm sure I have seen such cases where the person did submit a PR without assignment but was accepted only because he asked for assignment.\nIMHO this PR needs to be Open and the other PR for the Issue must be closed. But then again, I would leave that to Maintainers. @jayvdb it's your call :)\n@Daronion Please Open your PR again and wait till a maintainer comments on this. But please remember from next time on, Do Not work on a Issue Until assigned. If you want you can work on this issue on a separate  branch by asking to be assigned to the issue. And then if you find a solution for the issue. You can just comment on the issue about your approach, the maintainers will surely assign you the issue then.\nP.S:- It's @Naveen not @Naereen 😉","diffHunk":null,"author":{"login":"Naveenaidu","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/30195193?v=4","name":"Naveen Naidu"},"reactions":[],"createdAt":"2018-09-30T22:16:10Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-09-30T22:16:10Z"},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNTc2NzY2OA==","url":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/pull/2705#issuecomment-425767668","bodyText":"@rishabhgarg25699 this is very rude behaviour from you considering how many rules, you yourself have broken since you entered this org and as far as I see the earlier PR was opened without any requests for assignment for this issue, which make this one genuine.\nAgain I repeat, no need to use any form of strong language or bringing down someone like,\n\nYou did not make the rules of yours and also if want to only practise then you can do this in your github account on any your project\n\nWhen you yourself aren't aware of half of them.","diffHunk":null,"author":{"login":"ishanSrt","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/29859362?v=4","name":"Ishan Srivastava"},"reactions":[{"id":"MDg6UmVhY3Rpb24zMDE3Nzc0Mg==","createdAt":"2018-10-01T07:08:05Z","content":"THUMBS_UP","user":{"login":"palash25","name":"Palash Nigam"}},{"id":"MDg6UmVhY3Rpb24zMDE3Nzk4MA==","createdAt":"2018-10-01T07:15:55Z","content":"THUMBS_UP","user":{"login":"sks444","name":"Shrikrishna Singh"}},{"id":"MDg6UmVhY3Rpb24zMDE5NDk0MQ==","createdAt":"2018-10-01T13:32:41Z","content":"THUMBS_UP","user":{"login":"shikharvaish28","name":"Shikhar Vaish"}},{"id":"MDg6UmVhY3Rpb24zMDIyNjMyNA==","createdAt":"2018-10-01T23:30:30Z","content":"THUMBS_UP","user":{"login":"Utkarsh1308","name":"Utkarsh Sharma"}}],"createdAt":"2018-10-01T01:20:24Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-10-01T01:20:24Z"},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNTgxMTI5OA==","url":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/pull/2705#issuecomment-425811298","bodyText":"@ishanSrt @Daronion @Naveenaidu I am really very sorry for my hard language .
