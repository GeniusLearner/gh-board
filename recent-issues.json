When expanded, this looks too bloated:\n{\n  \"stuff\": {\n    \"itemA\": {\n      \"value\": 33,\n      \"doubled\": 66\n    },\n    \"itemB\": {\n      \"value\": 44,\n      \"doubled\": 88\n    },\n    \"itemC\": {\n      \"value\": 55,\n      \"doubled\": 110\n    },\n    \"itemD\": {\n      \"value\": 66,\n      \"doubled\": 132\n    }\n  }\n}\nSo I want a setting that allows me to control this expansion to a certain depth. For esxample in my case, I want to define something like expand_level=1, which will only expand the first level of the top-object, so only \"stuff\".\nIt's maybe also worth to have finer graded control for this as well for specific items, so new settings where you can specify which items to expand and which not.\nBut this should be done in another issue, noting this here so we don't forget.","comments":1,"createdAt":"2018-05-23T07:45:15Z","updatedAt":"2018-09-28T10:44:24Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"Makman2","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6023916?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"Makman2","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6023916?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"area/genericbears","color":"D01975"},{"name":"area/newsettings","color":"006b75"},{"name":"difficulty/low","color":"207de5"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala-bears","updatedAtMs":1537768619000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/issues/2516","number":2516,"title":"Add

data/cache version checking","body":"This was discussed briefly in #78, but I'll use this issue as a way to better express my ideas around the bigger problem here. Our data.(js|min.js|yml) files are going to be changing quite often while this site is in development, not just in their values but also in their keys.\nFor example, if we were to make some large changes to the data file. Let's say, for example, the desired effect of our change is to move the wikidata link of an organization to a new key:\n- \"wikidata_url\": \"//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q170855\"\n+ \"wikidata_link\": \"//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q170855\"\nWhen we deploy the code, it will still expect a \"wikidata_url\" key to exist, despite the name being changed to \"wikidata_link\". On top of that, the caching code will use the existing organization's object instead of making another API request to GCI (because we don't expect their returned data to change) so the \"wikidata_url\" will stick around along with the new \"wikidata_link\" leading to some very cluttered data.\nSo how do we fix this?\nPretty straight-forward. Adding a CACHE_VERSION or DATA_VERSION constant in our code and putting that value in our data.(js|min.js|yml) files will allow us to check if our data format is up to date. We would increment this version every time a breaking change is made to the data format (be it adding or removing a key, or updating the name of an existing key). If the DATA_VERSION we expect and the DATA_VERSION of the data file we're reading from don't match up, we ignore it and re-fetch all the data.","comments":1,"createdAt":"2017-12-14T03:53:42Z","updatedAt":"2018-09-20T12:00:22Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"andrewda","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/10191084?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"andrewda","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/10191084?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"difficulty/low","color":"59db91"},{"name":"status/STALE","color":"ededed"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"gci-leaders","updatedAtMs":1537444821000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/gci-leaders/issues/90","number":90,"title":"Stable JSON/YAML","body":"d278b4e contains a lot of unnecessary movement in the JSON/YAML, and some unreadable portions like coala & catrobat switching places.\nThe data should stay in the same order, to be VCS friendly.\nIf necessary, split the commits into\n\nchange data\nchange order","comments":2,"createdAt":"2017-12-18T02:33:37Z","updatedAt":"2018-09-20T12:00:21Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"difficulty/high","color":"a667f7"},{"name":"importance/low","color":"fcf1a6"},{"name":"status/STALE","color":"ededed"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"gci-leaders","updatedAtMs":1536729627000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/gci-leaders/issues/108","number":108,"title":"Add anchor for each org","body":"The block for each org should have an anchor\ne.g. https://gci-leaders.netlify.com/#coala should go directly to the coala section of the page","comments":4,"createdAt":"2017-12-22T01:00:09Z","updatedAt":"2018-09-12T05:20:27Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"pavankrishna13","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/32464579?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"difficulty/newcomer","color":"ffcce2"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"gci-leaders","updatedAtMs":1537444820000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/gci-leaders/issues/111","number":111,"title":"Use GraphQL API","body":"We should use GitHub's GraphQL API instead of the the REST API.

I am surprised that there are no forks which have modified this (c.f. #5), as that seems like a logical easy way to improve the front page (c.f. #3).\nIncluding configuration in the master branch causes forks to diverge.  We need to avoid that.\nSome options for where to put the configuration:\n\nthe wiki\na different branch\nan issue ;-)\n\nOr, the configuration could be all derived from GitHub, if we ignore SAMPLE_REPOS. (and if we build a way to easily configure the front page, nobody will try to abuse this anyway.)  It will increase build time to extract an ideal layout based on GitHub org/repo metadata.  Also fetching the list of repos for an org requires an extra scope which orgs may not want in their Travis env vars, and if they use secure vars in the .travis.yml , their fork diverges.","comments":1,"createdAt":"2017-12-22T05:38:50Z","updatedAt":"2018-09-10T03:28:12Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"difficulty/medium","color":"d30a8d"},{"name":"initiatives/gci","color":"e5ce95"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"gh-board","updatedAtMs":1538881682000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/gh-board/issues/50","number":50,"title":"src/lib/columns.js ignored by .gitignore","body":"$ git ls-files | git check-ignore --no-index --stdin -v\n.gitignore:80:[Ll]ib\tsrc/lib/columns.js\nAdded in 15a45ef\nPossibly rename the file, or add it as an exception in .moban.dt/gh-board-gitignore.jj2","comments":1,"createdAt":"2018-06-09T11:31:17Z","updatedAt":"2018-10-07T03:08:02Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"difficulty/newcomer","color":"33a7bf"},{"name":"importance/medium","color":"65f23e"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"landing-frontend","updatedAtMs":1538589389000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/landing-frontend/issues/245","number":245,"title":"Fix Indentation in the Project","body":"Most of the files in the project do not have the correct indentation on every line.\ndifficulty/low\nOpened by @yashovardhanagrawal at Gitter","comments":4,"createdAt":"2017-11-14T07:12:39Z","updatedAt":"2018-10-03T17:56:29Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"co-robo","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/29058257?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"co-robo","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/29058257?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"difficulty/low","color":"1d76db"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"landing-frontend","updatedAtMs":1538584672000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/landing-frontend/issues/277","number":277,"title":"Bookmarkable example on homepage","body":"Currently, when selecting to a language example, we have no way to bookmark it.\n\nThis can be done via adding a query parameter to the url after the selection.\nand add\ndocument.getElementById('example').scrollIntoView();\n\nafter adding id to the example's div","comments":6,"createdAt":"2018-05-23T09:19:20Z","updatedAt":"2018-10-03T16:37:52Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"bekicot","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1826884?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"bekicot","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1826884?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"anstkras","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/16261056?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"area/documentation","color":"ededed"},{"name":"difficulty/newcomer","color":"0e8a16"},{"name":"type/bug","color":"ee0701"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"landing-frontend","updatedAtMs":1538584436000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/landing-frontend/issues/282","number":282,"title":"Coala Online is broken due to CORS","body":"https://coala.io/#/coalaonline does not work due to the SOP security restrictions in browsers.
