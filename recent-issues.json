This issue doesnt intend to help with those cases.\nHowever other enclosing languages only allow specific languages to be nested inside them.\nExamples:\n\nLiterate Haskell allows Haskell inside.\nPHP allows HTML inside.\nVisual Basic allows XML inside (#5587)\n\nWe need to expand the language definition class to describe these relationships between outer and inner languages.","comments":1,"createdAt":"2018-09-20T23:31:35Z","updatedAt":"2018-09-20T23:40:54Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"area/languages","color":"d4c5f9"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala","updatedAtMs":1537431690000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/5757","number":5757,"title":"Test case failures in Python 3.8 (CPython master)","body":"I ran the test suite against the CPython master branch and I can see some test failures (Some of them are related to pip and pyparsing which have upstream issues).

data/cache version checking","body":"This was discussed briefly in #78, but I'll use this issue as a way to better express my ideas around the bigger problem here. Our data.(js|min.js|yml) files are going to be changing quite often while this site is in development, not just in their values but also in their keys.\nFor example, if we were to make some large changes to the data file. Let's say, for example, the desired effect of our change is to move the wikidata link of an organization to a new key:\n- \"wikidata_url\": \"//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q170855\"\n+ \"wikidata_link\": \"//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q170855\"\nWhen we deploy the code, it will still expect a \"wikidata_url\" key to exist, despite the name being changed to \"wikidata_link\". On top of that, the caching code will use the existing organization's object instead of making another API request to GCI (because we don't expect their returned data to change) so the \"wikidata_url\" will stick around along with the new \"wikidata_link\" leading to some very cluttered data.\nSo how do we fix this?\nPretty straight-forward. Adding a CACHE_VERSION or DATA_VERSION constant in our code and putting that value in our data.(js|min.js|yml) files will allow us to check if our data format is up to date. We would increment this version every time a breaking change is made to the data format (be it adding or removing a key, or updating the name of an existing key). If the DATA_VERSION we expect and the DATA_VERSION of the data file we're reading from don't match up, we ignore it and re-fetch all the data.","comments":1,"createdAt":"2017-12-14T03:53:42Z","updatedAt":"2018-09-20T12:00:22Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"andrewda","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/10191084?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"andrewda","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/10191084?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"difficulty/low","color":"59db91"},{"name":"status/STALE","color":"ededed"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"gci-leaders","updatedAtMs":1537444821000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/gci-leaders/issues/90","number":90,"title":"Stable JSON/YAML","body":"d278b4e contains a lot of unnecessary movement in the JSON/YAML, and some unreadable portions like coala & catrobat switching places.\nThe data should stay in the same order, to be VCS friendly.\nIf necessary, split the commits into\n\nchange data\nchange order","comments":2,"createdAt":"2017-12-18T02:33:37Z","updatedAt":"2018-09-20T12:00:21Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"difficulty/high","color":"a667f7"},{"name":"importance/low","color":"fcf1a6"},{"name":"status/STALE","color":"ededed"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"gci-leaders","updatedAtMs":1536729627000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/gci-leaders/issues/108","number":108,"title":"Add anchor for each org","body":"The block for each org should have an anchor\ne.g. https://gci-leaders.netlify.com/#coala should go directly to the coala section of the page","comments":4,"createdAt":"2017-12-22T01:00:09Z","updatedAt":"2018-09-12T05:20:27Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"pavankrishna13","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/32464579?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"difficulty/newcomer","color":"ffcce2"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"gci-leaders","updatedAtMs":1537444820000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/gci-leaders/issues/111","number":111,"title":"Use GraphQL API","body":"We should use GitHub's GraphQL API instead of the the REST API.

(All commits have to pass\nindividually. It is not sufficient to have \"fixup commits\" on your PR,\nour bot will still report the issues for the previous commit.) You will\nlikely receive a lot of bot comments and build failures if coala does not\npass on every single commit!\n\nAfter you submit your pull request, DO NOT click the 'Update Branch' button.\nWhen asked for a rebase, consult coala.io/rebase\ninstead.\nPlease consider helping us by reviewing other peoples pull requests as well:\n\npick up any PR at https://coala.io/review\nreview it (check https://coala.io/reviewing for more info)\nif you are sure that it needs work, use corobo mark wip <URL> to get it out\nof the review queue.\n\nThe more you review, the more your score will grow at coala.io and we will\nreview your PRs faster!","comments":20,"createdAt":"2018-09-03T03:31:22Z","updatedAt":"2018-09-20T09:57:56Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"Mah1ndra","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/32550072?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"Mah1ndra","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/32550072?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"Mah1ndra","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/32550072?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"difficulty/newcomer","color":"65C8FF"},{"name":"process/wip","color":"fbca04"},{"name":"size/XS","color":"00DE0F"}],"pullRequest":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/pull/5747","comments":[{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDIxNDYyODM4MA==","url":"https://github.com/coala/coala/pull/5747#discussion_r214628380","bodyText":"I see you are adding a lot of blank lines.

Just drop us a message and we'll take care of brushing\nup your stuff for merge!\nChecklist\n\n I read the commit guidelines and I've followed\nthem.\n I ran coala over my code locally. (All commits have to pass\nindividually. It is not sufficient to have \"fixup commits\" on your PR,\nour bot will still report the issues for the previous commit.) You will\nlikely receive a lot of bot comments and build failures if coala does not\npass on every single commit!\n\nAfter you submit your pull request, DO NOT click the 'Update Branch' button.\nWhen asked for a rebase, consult coala.io/rebase\ninstead.\nPlease consider helping us by reviewing other peoples pull requests as well:\n\npick up any PR at https://coala.io/review\nreview it (check https://coala.io/reviewing for more info)\nif you are sure that it needs work, use cobot mark wip <URL> to get it out\nof the review queue.\n\nThe more you review, the more your score will grow at coala.io and we will\nreview your PRs faster!","comments":0,"createdAt":"2018-08-31T05:01:12Z","updatedAt":"2018-09-20T12:24:21Z","closedAt":"2018-09-15T10:54:41Z","state":"closed","user":{"login":"hritikhks","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/39440248?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"hritikhks","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/39440248?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"jennyjj","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/27842224?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"difficulty/low","color":"1d76db"},{"name":"importance/low","color":"2fe055"},{"name":"process/pending review","color":"bfe5bf"},{"name":"size/XXL","color":"ededed"}],"pullRequest":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/projects/pull/658","comments":[{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDIxNDI1NjY2MA==","url":"https://github.com/coala/projects/pull/658#discussion_r214256660","bodyText":"Your commit message does not reflect your changes.
