When exiting the run, the Session checks if exceptions were placed into self.silent_errors/self.recovered_errors, constructs an Exceptions instance with all of those errors and raises it in the main thread.\nAcceptance criteria:\n\nAn exception is implemented that is capable of storing multiple exceptions and emitting an appropriate error message\ncore.run() raises this exception if at least one bear or result-callback failed.

It should be ordered alphabetically (that's what JSONBear already offers), but also contains many objects in an array that are very small and should be kept on a single line:\n{\n    \"stuff\": {\n        \"itemA\": {\"value\": 33, \"doubled\": 66},\n        \"itemB\": {\"value\": 44, \"doubled\": 88},\n        \"itemC\": {\"value\": 55, \"doubled\": 110},\n        \"itemD\": {\"value\": 66, \"doubled\": 132}\n    }\n}\nSo each line indicates a new item. When expanded, this looks too bloated:\n{\n  \"stuff\": {\n    \"itemA\": {\n      \"value\": 33,\n      \"doubled\": 66\n    },\n    \"itemB\": {\n      \"value\": 44,\n      \"doubled\": 88\n    },\n    \"itemC\": {\n      \"value\": 55,\n      \"doubled\": 110\n    },\n    \"itemD\": {\n      \"value\": 66,\n      \"doubled\": 132\n    }\n  }\n}\nSo I want a setting that allows me to control this expansion to a certain depth. For esxample in my case, I want to define something like expand_level=1, which will only expand the first level of the top-object, so only \"stuff\".\nIt's maybe also worth to have finer graded control for this as well for specific items, so new settings where you can specify which items to expand and which not.\nBut this should be done in another issue, noting this here so we don't forget.","comments":3,"createdAt":"2018-05-23T07:45:15Z","updatedAt":"2019-03-20T19:00:03Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"Makman2","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6023916?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"Makman2","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6023916?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"area/genericbears","color":"D01975"},{"name":"area/newsettings","color":"006b75"},{"name":"difficulty/low","color":"207de5"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala-bears","updatedAtMs":1552531674000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/issues/2306","number":2306,"title":"Improve regex for control tags in Jinja2Bear","body":"As of now, the regex checks for anything that contains for and if for control_start tags and endfor and endif for control_end tags.

these activities on the profile page (to be created) as it will save space on the leaderboard page and we can accumulate more data and columns.\nFiltering of records between GCI participants and NON-GCI participants.\n(Thinking on) Changing static website to dynamic website because the records of users are not static they change with time as they gain new skills, solve new issues, no more a GCI participant as they are have grown up (in terms of age) etc.\n\n\n\nHomepage\n\nWe can show up a leaderboard that shows up top 10(or more) contributors of the current month(a drop-down having options with the weekly, monthly or yearly view) and NON-GCI & GCI participants will have a separate leaderboard, will have a drop-down option.\n\n\n\nAdd Login/Sign-up using GitHub\n\n\nCreate Profile Page\n\nRequirements: User should be logged in using GitHub\nDisplay all user related information and stats like it's rank, issues solved by that user, graph, contribution details and many more.\n\n\n\nUser\n\nIf possible, we can store the contribution details of users i.e. how much a user has contributed to which repository/community more and we can display that data on the graph or in some other format.\nIn Leader-board, we can set username a hyperlink which will link to a profile page of the user(to be created).\nProvide gitter link to do private-chat with the contributor\n\n\n\nCommunity Members\n\nCurrently, static data of members of community is displayed  without any update in contributor-data. Making use of pagination and live query, the data of contributors can be updated.\nAlso, members in the community is not a constant quantity. It keeps on changing with time. Using live queries will maintain the records.\nData is currently being fetched from @sks444 contrib.json\n\n\n\nCommunity Logo + Header Image of README.md\n\nIssue reference - #55\n\nShould be replaced with a project specific logo which symbolises creating/supporting/growing communities.\n\n\n\n\n\nContributors Geolocation\n\nIssue reference - #18\n\nA way to get participants’ geolocation is important for any org to show its global influence, this can be used for map display and statistics.\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganisation Teams\n\nIssue reference - #12\nTeams Endpoint in GitHub API v3\n\n\n\nMentors\n\nIssue reference - #11\nWays we can achieve this -\na. Projects repository or\nb. The admin can enter the usernames of mentors through django admin dashboard or\nc. Create a Dashboard for Maintainers or Admins from where they can manage the website database.\n\n\n\nNewcomer Invitation form\n\n\nPromotion to developer form\n\nIssue Reference #89\n\n\n\nFeedback form\n\nIt is always useful to know what developers or community has a point\nof view for our community.\nLater we can use nltk to do NLP and get some great results about\nour community.\nPrimary, focus will be on to create a feedback form and a database model for it.\n\n\n\nAssigning Issue\n\nGet yourself assigned to issue\nBased on checks, the issue will be assigned -\n\nNot assigned to any other issue\nIf assigned, the issue has a PR to close it\n\n\n\n\n\nImprovements\n\n\nGamification Leaderboard\n\nDisplay all rendered results in a table format because currently the results are shown in a paragraph format\nTo make it more creative, we can show some medals/badge emojis based on data in badges columns and show these emoji beside the username.\n\n\n\nUI\n\nRe-designing of the website and making it responsive so that it looks good on different devices.\nIn Inactive Issue and unassigned issues activity web pages, instead of showing just JSON they should be displayed in proper format with some extra important information.\nContributors and Meta-Review data web pages should be redesigned to make it look good.\n\n\n\nVarious bug fixes -\n\nBuild failure for more than one remote #235\nNetlify build failure for fork #232\nRestructure and redesign existing website #44\n\nThis proposal closes this issues.\n\n\n\n\n\nImprovements and Enhancements in projects website\nEnhancements\n\n\nIn reference to project proposal #394\n\nCurrently, the website shows all projects together (Completed, Disabled and Open projects). Instead of showing them together we can group this projects so that user can easily navigate to any section.\nA new section can be added that can show the count of grouped projects(e.g. their x open projects, y disabled projects and z completed projects).\nAlso, IMO we can show stats of projects like how many new projects proposals were accepted out which how many were completed and compare it with previous years data. (Thinking more on it if it can be more enhanced).\nSince coala provides a linter for the code so we can provide information on how a particular completed project will benefit other orgs. And how they can use them in there code maintenance.\n\n\n\nAdd Filters for searching projects #559\n\n\nCreate tab for all the google forms #284\n\n\nAdd posts / calendar app to projects website #560\n\n\nGSoC Students\n\nShow all students that have been selected for GSoC in past years.\nDesign - A Collage or like admins/mentors are shown under mentors tab\nNote: Whether it should be displayed on projects website or on community website or on both?.\n\n\n\nImprovements\n\n\nUI\n\nRe-designing of Index Page\n\nIdeas to be taken from\na. Open Astronomy\nb. FOSSASIA Labs\nc. CCET College\n\n\nAdd UI to reports page that lists all previous year GSOC project.\nImprove UI of user reports page.\n\nThe responsive view looks to ugly need to be improved.\n\n\n\n\n\nVarious bug fixes -\n\nMark issues - Open, Merged or Closed #298\n\nUse of github & gitlab api - functionality can be added to webservices\n\n\nRemove completed projects or \"Completed\" tags for projects #342\n\nProposal splits the projects into different sections\n\n\n\n\n\nExtension to GSoC 2018 project with  new additions and in reference to project proposal.\nSome enhancements and improvements needs new methods in webservices","comments":8,"createdAt":"2018-11-17T13:27:07Z","updatedAt":"2019-03-16T04:08:15Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"KVGarg","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/35761292?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"KVGarg","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/35761292?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"KVGarg","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/35761292?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"Project Proposal","color":"f9d0c4"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"projects","updatedAtMs":1554031565000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/projects/issues/574","number":574,"title":"New Project: mobanise tool","body":"The process of converting a project to moban is similar to the coala-quickstart problem solved in the GSoC 2017 quickstart project\nA lot of information needs to be extracted from various existing files, converted to yaml, and then moban run to generate those same files, and various commands run to identify what functional changes have been made by using the moban templates, and a human checking those changes to see if they were good.\nBefore this project is started, the info extraction components from quickstart need to be moved to a new library.

This was happening on Python3.4 because jsonschema dropped support for Python3.4 and which bumped the requirement to six>=1.11.0 while everyone else had six>=1.10.0.

This also means that if the packages update their six dependency or the build start to break this will need change as per them.\nI still think this not a good best approach of handling version conflicts, but the way pip works right now, its hard to find a good fix.

I don't know why people built a custom parser and configuration format instead of using a standard one, but maybe there is some reason.\nWhen coala started out, the syntax did not require custom sub level parsing, so INI style config was good and sufficient.\nBut when we started to implement aspects we had to face with tough task of custom sub level parsing. This makes LineParser and ConfParser more complex and error prone.  coala/coala#4511.  Now it would be nice to have a config system where we would not be limited by its complexity.  It would be much more comfortable if we can focus on implementation of a feature and worry less about how to make the parser accommodate the feature.\nThere will be many edge cases in integrating the TOML format .\nThe only challenge is to define the mapping between current coafile syntax and TOML syntax.\nbears = SpaceConsistencyBear, LineLengthBear can be easily mapped to bears = [ \"SpaceConsistencyBear\", \"LineLengthBear\" ].\nBut what does files += app.py  map into in TOML ? This has to be decided by the community. What syntax would they like ? No matter what syntax they may like, it can be easily implemented in TOML.\nOther challenge is that TOML parser does not load comments. There is an existing issue to solve this.\nwrite down what will break\nAccording to my current plan, absolutely nothing shall break down. I shall not be altering/interfering any existing functionality.  I will add classes like TomlConfWriter , TomlConfParser  etc, but not break/alter anything.\nThe project flows from configuration to processing to actions. I shall not have to worry about anything that comes after configuration like processing and actions. This is due to the fact that after configuration gathering code provides sections to processing, it goes out of focus. Now I shall create a system that will convert TOML file into sections. So I will not be interfering with the existing parsers and writers of coafile as well . This way I shall not touch the exiting configuration system as well. Essentially no existing parts are modified. The existing Section and Settings class will be used as they are without changing them.\n\nI have written a very detailed plan in https://github.com/PrajwalM2212/Coala-GSoC-Plan.\nI have read the codebase and made a implementation guide.
