The only option seems to follow is use custom contract type eg.\nnew_contract('valid_name', lambda s: isinstance(s, str) and len(s)>0)\n@contract(names='dict(int: (valid_name, int))')\ndef process_accounting(records):\n    ...\n\nThe problem occurring over here is the function name provided to the new_contract method gets the value of the argument implicitly as the one and only argument. Since this doesn't even receive the self or any other kind of variable its impossible to access other objects from inside this method which means we can't populate a class for storing metadata of the acceptable set of values and unless we modify contracts itself or define the acceptable set of values in the function itself. When defining the acceptable values in the function itself it is impossible to access those values outside the method thus defeating the purpose. contracts also follows a strict syntax which makes it impossible to predefine a custom set of methods for each kind of setting in the base classes to which the actual bear can just pass the acceptable values and the setting list to compare against. Everything needs to be implemented in each bear itself. Summing up things like\n[new_contract(i, lambda s: isinstance(s, str) and len(s)>0) for i in in setting_list]\n\nalso doesn't work which makes the code much more difficult to read. The usage of contracts module also provides difficulty when the some default values of the bear setting are assumed in case of the value to the setting is not provided or invalid value is given.\nUsing Type hints provided by python\nThese are pretty much worthless. They can be only used for documentation purposes unless the type checking is performed specially with loading the mypy module which just checks for type hint inconsistencies and doesn't actually run the program. (Haven't tested this out with custom classes). Normal runs of the code don't point out any inconsistencies in invalid types according to type hints.\nWriting code and manual checks for each setting in some way or the other\nThis should be the last resort unless an elegant way is devised. Can be done using decorators or the bear code is itself but a common set of classnames have to be come upon which will be used by all the bears to extract out information about these settings. This can be performed by adding classes to the base class and asking the bear writers to fill them up. Functions can also be made in the base classes to test out settings to automatically provide just the setting and the default values, calling the correct function for the correct setting type and checking whether the value provided is valid or not.","comments":16,"createdAt":"2018-06-10T06:59:58Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-11T05:42:56Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"ishanSrt","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/29859362?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"ishanSrt","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/29859362?v=4"},"labels":[]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala-bears","updatedAtMs":1534394227000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/issues/2304","number":2304,"title":"GitCommitBearTest.py : Typo in line 50","body":"There's a typo at https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/blob/master/tests/vcs/git/GitCommitBearTest.py#L50\nmessgae -> message","comments":5,"createdAt":"2018-03-03T17:52:58Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-16T04:37:07Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"virresh","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10978108?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"virresh","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10978108?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"codeKAMAT","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/36402247?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"area/documentation","color":"c5def5"},{"name":"difficulty/newcomer","color":"65C8FF"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala-bears","updatedAtMs":1535295907000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/issues/2383","number":2383,"title":"Add package-lock.json to .gitignore","body":"package-lock.json is a lock file of JS dependencies.\ndifficulty/new comer","comments":8,"createdAt":"2018-03-28T10:41:40Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-26T15:05:07Z","closedAt":"2018-05-24T13:22:08Z","state":"closed","user":{"login":"sangamcse","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/26381717?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"sangamcse","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/26381717?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"difficulty/newcomer","color":"65C8FF"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala-bears","updatedAtMs":1535723025000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/issues/2453","number":2453,"title":"CIRCLE_NODE_INDEX hack for travis is not required anymore","body":".travis.yml sets CIRCLE_NODE_INDEX=-1 to avoid being a circle worker\nRemove code related to this hack as pip deps are no more called from travis","comments":2,"createdAt":"2018-04-26T16:47:58Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-31T13:43:45Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"harshhx17","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/31805694?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"harshhx17","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/31805694?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"area/ci","color":"d93f0b"},{"name":"difficulty/newcomer","color":"65C8FF"},{"name":"importance/low","color":"70e870"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala-bears","updatedAtMs":1534436530000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/issues/2062","number":2062,"title":"JSONFormatBear complains about number representation","body":"Let's say I have a file test.json for a simulation I'm running,\n{\n    \"expansion-coefficient\": 23.4e-6\n}\nNow, when I run coala -b JSONFormatBear --files=test.json, it wants to change the number to 2.34e-05, which is of course mathematically equivalent.

The mapping isnt exact, but the benefits of using the test result format is tight integration with various system.\nCircleCI can accept this format: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/collect-test-data/\nAppVeyor can receive a test results XML format, in the format output by xunit, presumably the same as JUnit.\nhttps://www.appveyor.com/docs/running-tests/#uploading-xml-test-results\nThe first project phase could involve converting the JSON to JUnit format and uploading into Circle CI and Appveyor.\nThe JUnit format should also be tested with a Jenkins install, to ensure it is uploading correctly there.  This would mean our Jenkins project is much less important.\nAnother common format is TAP.\nAnd there is Clover XML format.\nThen there are some system, such as Phabricator, which have a custom format they expect.\nc.f. facebook/infer#673\nThe above probably doesnt fill 3 months.\nPulling the coala results from CI using this format could be a way to inform newbies of the style problems with their PRs.\nAnother way to expand this project is to also push the unit test results as XML to the CI (using combination XML files if necessary)","comments":3,"createdAt":"2018-04-17T11:07:57Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-10T16:21:54Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"Project Proposal","color":"f9d0c4"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"projects","updatedAtMs":1533284698000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/projects/issues/564","number":564,"title":"Split repology project into two projects","body":"We have two different projects both utilising Repology for installation.\nAnd there is only one repology project here: https://github.com/coala/projects/blob/master/_projects/automate_dependacy_repology.md\nAlso relevant is the cib project, which will also be improving our dependency management, but it will be fixing an end-user tool, and will likely be trying to leverage conda to help get the dependencies installed.\nAs a result, the cib project will inevitable be solving the pip dependencies.\nThe 'Go on BSD' project is clearly about Go, and only Go.  The meat of this project is supporting lots of versions of Go, and different BSD, and possible also other more obscure OS like Alpine Linux.\nThe current repology project is about getting 'all' linters linked to Repology.\nI suspect the timeline is not allowing enough time for the process of creating Repology packages for linters that are not yet in Repology, and it seems large numbers of them are missing.  So this will take quite a bit longer than planned.  We'll need to look at various methods of automating the process.  Maybe we rename it to be the 'repology metadata' project.  It will still need to include implementation of the installation routines, but it probably wont have time to solve installation of every bear.  Perhaps it should focus only on linters managed via ruby bundler, and or npm.

The old bears expect that currently.\n\nIs there a part of the codebase where we can make changes so that all the bears receive only the file contents and not the objects so that we don't have to change the bears implementation individually, you know like a middleware between the collection of objects and the actual analysis?\n\nYeah inside Processing.py. Instead of giving bears the file factory objects, give them file_factory.lines. I know we currently loose the lazy-loading capability with that, but that's easiest for now.\nIf you want to keep the lazy loading capabilities, we could write (like you suggested) some kind of \"middleware\", meaning we have a proxy dict object that gives access to file contents that works the same way as before for bears, but calls the right functions of FileFactory in the background.\nLike:\nclass FileDict:  # mimics dict\n    def __getitem__(self, filename):\n        return self._my_file_middlewares[filename]\n    #...\n\nclass FileMiddleware:\n    def __getitem__(self, lineindex):\n        return self._underlying_file_proxy.lines[lineindex]\n    #...","diffHunk":"@@ -13,6 +13,6 @@ def run(self, filename, file):\n         \"\"\"\n         yield Result.from_values(\n             origin=self,\n-            message='This file has {count} lines.'.format(count=len(file)),\n+            message='This file has {count} lines.'.format(count=len(file.lines)),","author":{"login":"Makman2","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6023916?v=4","name":"Mischa Krüger"},"createdAt":"2018-07-20T16:54:36Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-07-20T16:54:36Z"},{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDIwNDEyNTkyMw==","url":"https://github.com/coala/coala/pull/5627#discussion_r204125923","bodyText":"fine with me 👍","diffHunk":"@@ -267,16 +268,17 @@ def get_file_dict(filename_list, log_printer=None, allow_raw_files=False):\n     :return:                Reads the content of each file into a dictionary\n                             with filenames as keys.\n     \"\"\"\n-    file_dict = {}\n+    file_set = {}","author":{"login":"Makman2","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6023916?v=4","name":"Mischa Krüger"},"createdAt":"2018-07-20T18:05:27Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-07-20T18:05:27Z"},{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDIwNDEyNjI3OA==","url":"https://github.com/coala/coala/pull/5627#discussion_r204126278","bodyText":"Its to invoke FileFactory.string in case of raw files to raise a UnicodeDecode error so that we can move into the except clause that handles the raw files.

little bit of explanation: the Green Mode Project requires to differentiate between settings which can attain a specific set of values.

The Green Mode project requires the valid values of these settings so that it can run coala over and over again by giving the bears all these values.

If it doesnt work with only minor implementation issues, I will implement it myself as a demo.\nIf I cant get it to work, we may revisit this decorator approach.\nNote also that this decorator would not be usable in coala-bears repo until we do a release of coala, and that is a huge risk to take for any project, especially given that I uncovered that there are ~20 bears tests broken when using coala master (and @sangamcse has reproduced it, and was going to investigate further; https://gitter.im/coala/coala?at=5b274d604755974910317329), so that is another task someone needs to do before we can do a pre-release and use anything in coalib from coala-bears.","diffHunk":null,"author":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4","name":"John Vandenberg"},"createdAt":"2018-06-18T06:14:54Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-06-18T06:14:54Z"},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMjgwNjk5Nw==","url":"https://github.com/coala/coala/pull/5523#issuecomment-412806997","bodyText":"It was demostrated Settings do work, even if a bit ugly without a bit of extra glue in StringConverter.\nhttps://gitlab.com/coala/coala-utils/issues/73 is highly desirable and https://gitlab.com/coala/coala-utils/issues/77 also avoids many problems with the current __path__ approach.","diffHunk":null,"author":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4","name":"John Vandenberg"},"createdAt":"2018-08-14T09:11:14Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-08-14T09:11:14Z"}]}}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala","updatedAtMs":1535417369000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/pull/5171","number":5171,"title":"Update rel-notes.txt","body":"For short term contributors: we understand that getting your commits well\ndefined like we require is a hard task and takes some learning.
