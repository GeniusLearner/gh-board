It should be ordered alphabetically (that's what JSONBear already offers), but also contains many objects in an array that are very small and should be kept on a single line:\n{\n    \"stuff\": {\n        \"itemA\": {\"value\": 33, \"doubled\": 66},\n        \"itemB\": {\"value\": 44, \"doubled\": 88},\n        \"itemC\": {\"value\": 55, \"doubled\": 110},\n        \"itemD\": {\"value\": 66, \"doubled\": 132}\n    }\n}\nSo each line indicates a new item. When expanded, this looks too bloated:\n{\n  \"stuff\": {\n    \"itemA\": {\n      \"value\": 33,\n      \"doubled\": 66\n    },\n    \"itemB\": {\n      \"value\": 44,\n      \"doubled\": 88\n    },\n    \"itemC\": {\n      \"value\": 55,\n      \"doubled\": 110\n    },\n    \"itemD\": {\n      \"value\": 66,\n      \"doubled\": 132\n    }\n  }\n}\nSo I want a setting that allows me to control this expansion to a certain depth. For esxample in my case, I want to define something like expand_level=1, which will only expand the first level of the top-object, so only \"stuff\".\nIt's maybe also worth to have finer graded control for this as well for specific items, so new settings where you can specify which items to expand and which not.\nBut this should be done in another issue, noting this here so we don't forget.","comments":3,"createdAt":"2018-05-23T07:45:15Z","updatedAt":"2019-03-20T19:00:03Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"Makman2","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6023916?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"Makman2","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6023916?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"area/genericbears","color":"D01975"},{"name":"area/newsettings","color":"006b75"},{"name":"difficulty/low","color":"207de5"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala-bears","updatedAtMs":1551768637000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/issues/2277","number":2277,"title":"Improve documentation of CSVLintBear","body":"","comments":5,"createdAt":"2018-02-10T17:51:11Z","updatedAt":"2019-03-05T06:50:37Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"kriti21","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19872082?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"kriti21","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19872082?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"chay2199","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/33033514?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"area/documentation","color":"c5def5"},{"name":"difficulty/low","color":"207de5"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala-bears","updatedAtMs":1552531674000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/issues/2306","number":2306,"title":"Improve regex for control tags in Jinja2Bear","body":"As of now, the regex checks for anything that contains for and if for control_start tags and endfor and endif for control_end tags.

I don't know why people built a custom parser and configuration format instead of using a standard one, but maybe there is some reason.\nWhen coala started out, the syntax did not require custom sub level parsing, so INI style config was good and sufficient.\nBut when we started to implement aspects we had to face with tough task of custom sub level parsing. This makes LineParser and ConfParser more complex and error prone.  coala/coala#4511.  Now it would be nice to have a config system where we would not be limited by its complexity.  It would be much more comfortable if we can focus on implementation of a feature and worry less about how to make the parser accommodate the feature.\nThere will be many edge cases in integrating the TOML format .\nThe only challenge is to define the mapping between current coafile syntax and TOML syntax.\nbears = SpaceConsistencyBear, LineLengthBear can be easily mapped to bears = [ \"SpaceConsistencyBear\", \"LineLengthBear\" ].\nBut what does files += app.py  map into in TOML ? This has to be decided by the community. What syntax would they like ? No matter what syntax they may like, it can be easily implemented in TOML.\nOther challenge is that TOML parser does not load comments. There is an existing issue to solve this.\nwrite down what will break\nAccording to my current plan, absolutely nothing shall break down. I shall not be altering/interfering any existing functionality.  I will add classes like TomlConfWriter , TomlConfParser  etc, but not break/alter anything.\nThe project flows from configuration to processing to actions. I shall not have to worry about anything that comes after configuration like processing and actions. This is due to the fact that after configuration gathering code provides sections to processing, it goes out of focus. Now I shall create a system that will convert TOML file into sections. So I will not be interfering with the existing parsers and writers of coafile as well . This way I shall not touch the exiting configuration system as well. Essentially no existing parts are modified. The existing Section and Settings class will be used as they are without changing them.\n\nI have written a very detailed plan in https://github.com/PrajwalM2212/Coala-GSoC-Plan.\nI have read the codebase and made a implementation guide.

In fact, you cannot change the commit message via Github. The reason being the hash for every Git commit is also calculated based on the commit message. When you change the commit message, you change the commit hash. If you want to push that commit, you have to force that push . Which is not possible via Github. In short - You cannot change the commit message using the Github Interface.\nPlease use git commit --amend in your terminal to update your message.\nAnd the details\nThis enhancement commit displays the contributor image\nalong with the information on the [community website](http://community.coala.io/contributors/).\n\nCloses #139 and #141\n\nShould be added while you make changes into the commit message.","diffHunk":null,"author":{"login":"Naveenaidu","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/30195193?v=4","name":"Naveen Naidu"},"reactions":[{"id":"MDg6UmVhY3Rpb24zNjg2MTU2OQ==","createdAt":"2019-02-12T11:31:53Z","content":"THUMBS_UP","user":{"login":"KVGarg","name":"Keshav Garg"}}],"createdAt":"2019-02-12T11:22:06Z","lastEditedAt":"2019-02-12T11:24:54Z","updatedAt":"2019-02-12T11:24:54Z"},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MjcyNDk3Nw==","url":"https://github.com/coala/community/pull/231#issuecomment-462724977","bodyText":"Ok @Naveenaidu I will make that change via terminal","diffHunk":null,"author":{"login":"KVGarg","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/35761292?v=4","name":"Keshav Garg"},"reactions":[],"createdAt":"2019-02-12T11:32:15Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2019-02-12T11:32:15Z"},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MjczMTYwMg==","url":"https://github.com/coala/community/pull/231#issuecomment-462731602","bodyText":"@KVGarg See this and update your commit body.","diffHunk":null,"author":{"login":"bkhanale","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/23272598?v=4","name":"Bhushan Khanale"},"reactions":[{"id":"MDg6UmVhY3Rpb24zNjg2MzA2MA==","createdAt":"2019-02-12T11:57:22Z","content":"THUMBS_UP","user":{"login":"KVGarg","name":"Keshav Garg"}}],"createdAt":"2019-02-12T11:55:19Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2019-02-12T11:55:19Z"},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MjczNTA0Nw==","url":"https://github.com/coala/community/pull/231#issuecomment-462735047","bodyText":"@bkhanale This isn't getting changed.
