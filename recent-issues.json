Build tools like Tox create temporary folders with multitude of files, and coala on every run will index them first and then filter them out. In a small project the indexing and filtering can take about 75% of the execution time (80 seconds). This should be fixed by filtering during the process of indexing.","comments":0,"createdAt":"2019-05-04T05:40:27Z","updatedAt":"2019-05-04T05:40:27Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"abraverm","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/7045898?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"abraverm","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/7045898?v=4"},"labels":[]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala","updatedAtMs":1554878604000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/6009","number":6009,"title":"Travis CI Sentinel build failing due to new version of pytest-xdist installed","body":"Overview Description\nSteps to Reproduce\n\nClone the coala repository\nInstall test-requirements.txt\nFigure out which version of pytest-xdist is installed.

The mapping isnt exact, but the benefits of using the test result format is tight integration with various system.\nCircleCI can accept this format: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/collect-test-data/\nAppVeyor can receive a test results XML format, in the format output by xunit, presumably the same as JUnit.\nhttps://www.appveyor.com/docs/running-tests/#uploading-xml-test-results\nThe first project phase could involve converting the JSON to JUnit format and uploading into Circle CI and Appveyor.\nThe JUnit format should also be tested with a Jenkins install, to ensure it is uploading correctly there.  This would mean our Jenkins project is much less important.\nAnother common format is TAP.\nAnd there is Clover XML format.\nThen there are some system, such as Phabricator, which have a custom format they expect.\nc.f. facebook/infer#673\nThe above probably doesnt fill 3 months.\nPulling the coala results from CI using this format could be a way to inform newbies of the style problems with their PRs.\nAnother way to expand this project is to also push the unit test results as XML to the CI (using combination XML files if necessary)","comments":19,"createdAt":"2018-04-17T11:07:57Z","updatedAt":"2019-05-07T12:19:25Z","closedAt":"2019-05-07T12:19:25Z","state":"closed","user":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"li-boxuan","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/25746010?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"Project Proposal","color":"f9d0c4"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"corobo","updatedAtMs":1554998151000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/corobo/issues/656","number":656,"title":"Corobo CI Failing due to old pytest version","body":"The corobo build is failing due to a old version to pytest.\nPlugin 'xdist' could not be loaded: (pytest 3.6.4 (/home/travis/virtualenv/python3.6.3/lib/python3.6/site-packages), Requirement.parse('pytest>=4.4.0'))!\nDifficulty : newcomer","comments":0,"createdAt":"2019-04-11T15:54:51Z","updatedAt":"2019-04-11T15:55:51Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"sladyn98","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/28837406?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"sladyn98","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/28837406?v=4"},"labels":[]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"corobo","updatedAtMs":1556392164000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/corobo/issues/528","number":528,"title":"[Plugin Proposal]: suggest_issues: Suggest issues as per difficulty level","body":"Bot will randomly select 5 unassigned issues from all coala repositories and suggest it based on the asked difficulty level.\ncorobo suggest issue <newcomer/low/medium/high>","comments":0,"createdAt":"2018-05-16T12:24:03Z","updatedAt":"2019-04-27T19:09:24Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"nvzard","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/19310512?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"nvzard","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/19310512?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"nvzard","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/19310512?v=4"},"labels":[]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"corobo","updatedAtMs":1556420357000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/corobo/issues/542","number":542,"title":"Some sort of tests to test regexes that we are using","body":"We have a lot of re_botcmd's and some of them are pretty complex.

I don't know why people built a custom parser and configuration format instead of using a standard one, but maybe there is some reason.\nWhen coala started out, the syntax did not require custom sub level parsing, so INI style config was good and sufficient.\nBut when we started to implement aspects we had to face with tough task of custom sub level parsing. This makes LineParser and ConfParser more complex and error prone.  coala/coala#4511.  Now it would be nice to have a config system where we would not be limited by its complexity.  It would be much more comfortable if we can focus on implementation of a feature and worry less about how to make the parser accommodate the feature.\nThere will be many edge cases in integrating the TOML format .\nThe only challenge is to define the mapping between current coafile syntax and TOML syntax.\nbears = SpaceConsistencyBear, LineLengthBear can be easily mapped to bears = [ \"SpaceConsistencyBear\", \"LineLengthBear\" ].\nBut what does files += app.py  map into in TOML ? This has to be decided by the community. What syntax would they like ? No matter what syntax they may like, it can be easily implemented in TOML.\nOther challenge is that TOML parser does not load comments. There is an existing issue to solve this.\nwrite down what will break\nAccording to my current plan, absolutely nothing shall break down. I shall not be altering/interfering any existing functionality.  I will add classes like TomlConfWriter , TomlConfParser  etc, but not break/alter anything.\nThe project flows from configuration to processing to actions. I shall not have to worry about anything that comes after configuration like processing and actions. This is due to the fact that after configuration gathering code provides sections to processing, it goes out of focus. Now I shall create a system that will convert TOML file into sections. So I will not be interfering with the existing parsers and writers of coafile as well . This way I shall not touch the exiting configuration system as well. Essentially no existing parts are modified. The existing Section and Settings class will be used as they are without changing them.\n\nI have written a very detailed plan in https://github.com/PrajwalM2212/Coala-GSoC-Plan.\nI have read the codebase and made a implementation guide.

The mapping\n+isn't exact, but the benefits of using the test result format is tight\n+integration with various systems.\n+\n+Most commonly used is JUnit format. CircleCI can accept\n+[this format](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/collect-test-data). AppVeyor can\n+receive test results in [XML format](https://www.appveyor.com/docs/running-tests/#uploading-xml-test-results).\n+Other formats include [TAP](https://testanything.org/),\n+[Clover](http://openclover.org/doc/manual/latest/ant--clover-report.html),\n+There are some systems, such as Phabricator, which have a\n+[custom format](https://github.com/facebook/infer/issues/673) they expect.\n+\n+The applicant is welcomed to propose additional ideas around format topic, to\n+improve coala workflow, continuous integration workflow or linters workflow.\n+For example, pulling the coala results from CI could be a way to inform newbies\n+of the style problems with their PRs. Pushing the unit test results as XML to\n+the CI (using combination XML files if necessary). It might also provide\n+linters with a solid set of classes and output formats for their CLI, letting\n+them focus on linting algorithms.\n+\n+#### Milestones\n+\n+##### PREPARATION/BONDING\n+\n+- The applicant has created and merged a cEP for this project.\n+- The applicant has done research on different formats, including JUnit,\n+  checkstyle, TAP, Language Server Protocol (LSP), etc.\n+- The applicant has done research on different formats required by CI\n+  tools and platforms, including Jenkins, Circle CI, Appveyor, Phabricator, etc.\n+\n+##### CODING PHASE 1\n+\n+- A tool that converts JSON results to JUnit format is implemented, tested,\n+  and documented.\n+- Test and add doc regarding how to upload coala results into Circle CI and\n+  Appveyor.\n+- Add infrastructure (CI, doc) to coala-json repository, where most part of\n+  this project will probably reside.\n+\n+##### CODING PHASE 2\n+\n+- Extend the tool to support different formats, including Checkstyle format,\n+  TAP, Clover.\n+- Test and add doc regarding how to upload coala results into Jenkins and\n+  Phabricator.\n+- Import converters into coala main repository to improve coala output mode.\n+\n+##### CODING PHASE 3\n+\n+- Provide various linters with a solid set of classes and output formats for\n+  their CLI.\n+- Handle JSON/xml reports from linters before feeding into linter bears.","author":{"login":"AkshJain99","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/29670791?v=4","name":"Akshit Jain"},"reactions":[],"createdAt":"2019-04-02T16:25:05Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2019-04-02T16:25:05Z"},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1OTc5MDI2Mg==","url":"https://github.com/coala/projects/pull/704#issuecomment-459790262","bodyText":"Deploy preview: https://deploy-preview-704--coala-projects.netlify.com/#/projects?project=result_reporter_tool","diffHunk":null,"author":{"login":"li-boxuan","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/25746010?v=4","name":"Boxuan Li"},"reactions":[],"createdAt":"2019-02-01T16:55:29Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2019-02-01T16:55:29Z"},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NTk1OTY2OQ==","url":"https://github.com/coala/projects/pull/704#issuecomment-475959669","bodyText":"I'm getting a lot confused over coding-phase 3.
