Raise exception in core.run() when bear or result-callback raised an exception","body":"Currently the core properly cleans up the failing bear and discards all dependent tasks and bears, and then swallows the exception.\nHowever, coala (and other users) needs to know that something didn't work perfectly, for example returning an error code that some analysis was run, but couldn't complete due to errors.\nI propose to write a custom exception that aggregates all those swallowed exceptions and is then raised in core.run().\nclass Exceptions(Exception):\n    def __init__(self, exceptions):\n        super().__init__('Multiple exceptions happened:\\n' + '\\n\\n'.join(str(ex) for ex in exceptions)\n        self.exceptions = exceptions\nTo make use of it, the core Session has another field,

And, it becomes difficult to carry laptops everywhere or using a website to browse through issues or commenting on a PR via mobile. For not to happen this, we can create a one-stop application for developers or contributors that can help them to know about our org and provide some features/functionalities to them so that they can contribute to our org, from anywhere at anytime.\nSometimes, a contributors gets into a situation where they think that \"I can do much better things then what I am currently doing\" or \"I can utilize this free time what I have got\", this way if they were contributing to our org or want to so some contribution, then that contributor can use this app to know about the org and can do much more things that I will be explaining further what all can a contributor do with this app.\nWe can provide following features/functionalities to contributors:\n\n\nNewcomer's Section\n\nNetlify-form link (existing issue in community repository ) or we can create a form layout in mobile-app that can somehow send an API request to netlify-form (if possible), the form will be used to join coala org asking about user details and taking input of an issue reference on which the user want to work (optional)\nList out all newcomer issues\ndisplay the joining's of new contributors in past month and past year, to motivate the new joining user\n\n\n\nIntegrate-coala\n\nWill work online as well as offline\nOFFLINE: Any project in mobile storage will not require internet to run coala on it.\nONLINE: Any project uploaded on GitHub or on any other service, requires internet to fetch files.\n\n\n\nAbout and Settings section\n\n\nFeedback form\n\n\nPR pending for review\n\nEither redirect user to web-page on choosing a PR or display all comments under a PR on the app itself\nUser/Contributor can also comment on a PR\n\n\n\nUser profile\n\nCreated Issues/PR\nrest all the mandatory sections that are always present in a profile section\n\n\n\nCreate an Issue form\n\n\nFor now, this is all what I have in mind.

Leaderboard\n\nAddition of a new column named issues that will show all the labels of issues that user has solved.\nAddition of a Search bar where a user can search any username in case there is a long record displayed on the page and a filter option can also be provided where the user wants to view a set of records according to his needs.\nIf possible, we can add a new column in leaderboard which will display the total time taken by the user to solve all the issues that were assigned to him.\nInstead of displaying activities on the leaderboard page we can show these activities on the profile page (to be created) as it will save space on the leaderboard page and we can accumulate more data and columns.\nFiltering of records between GCI participants and NON-GCI participants.\n(Thinking on) Changing static website to dynamic website because the records of users are not static they change with time as they gain new skills, solve new issues, no more a GCI participant as they are have grown up etc.\n\n\n\nHomepage\n\nWe can show up a leaderboard that shows up top 10 contributors of the current month(a drop-down having options with the weekly, monthly or yearly view) and NON-GCI and GCI participants will have a separate leaderboard, will have a drop-down option.\n\n\n\nAdd Login/Sign-up using GitHub\n\n\nCreate Profile Page\n\nRequirements: User should be logged in using GitHub\nDisplay all user related information and stats like it's rank, issues solved by that user, graph, contribution details and many more.\n\n\n\nUser\n\nIf possible, we can store the contribution details of users i.e. how much a user has contributed to which repository/community more and we can display that data on the graph or in some other format.\nIn Leaderboard, we can set username a hyperlink which will link to a profile page of the user(to be created).\n\n\n\nCommunity Members\n\nCurrently, static data of members of community is displayed  without any update in contributor-data. Making use of pagination and live query, the data of contributors can be updated.\nAlso, members in the community is not a constant quantity. It keeps on changing with time. Using live queries will maintain the records.\nData is currently being fetched from https://rawgit.com/sks444/webservices.coala.io/master/contrib.json\n\n\n\nImprovements\n\n\nGamification Leaderboard\n\nDisplay all rendered results in a table format because currently the results are shown in a paragraph format\nTo make it more creative, we can show some medals/badge emojis based on data in badges columns and show these emoji beside the username.\n\n\n\nUI\n\nRe-designing of the website and making it responsive so that it looks good on different devices.\nIn Inactive Issue and unassigned issues activity web pages, instead of showing just JSON they should be displayed in proper format with some extra important information.\nContributors and Meta-Review data web pages should be redesignedto make it look good.\n\n\n\nImprovements and Enhancements in projects website\nEnhancements\n\nIn reference to project proposal #394\n\nCurrently, the website shows all projects together (Completed, Disabled and Open projects). Instead of showing them together we can group this projects so that user can easily navigate to any section.\nA new section can be added that can show the count of grouped projects(e.g. their x open projects, y disabled projects and z completed projects).\nAlso, IMO we can show stats of projects like how many new projects proposals were accepted out which how many were completed and compare it with previous years data. (Thinking more on it if it can be more enhanced).\nSince coala provides a linter for the code so we can provide information on how a particular completed project will benefit other orgs. And how they can use them in there code maintenance.\nPENDING: Requirement analysis of other GSoC and GCI Orgs.\n\n\n\nImprovements\n\nUI\n\nAdd UI to reports page that lists all previous year GSOC project.\nImprove UI of user reports page.\nThe responsive view looks to ugly need to be improved and materialize.css should be replaced by bootstrap.\nLanguage drop-down at the bottom of the page doesn't seem to be working so either it should be removed or add some functionality to implement that language changer of the page.\n\n\n\nExtension to GSoC 2018 project with  new additions and in reference to project proposal.","comments":1,"createdAt":"2018-11-17T13:27:07Z","updatedAt":"2019-02-08T09:49:44Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"KVGarg","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/35761292?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"KVGarg","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/35761292?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"Project Proposal","color":"f9d0c4"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"projects","updatedAtMs":1547981950000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/projects/issues/695","number":695,"title":"Enhance coala-html and integrate into coala core","body":"https://github.com/coala/coala-html is a nice project, but it is an angular application which limits its user scenario and popularity.

This would mean our Jenkins project is much less important.\nAnother common format is TAP.\nAnd there is Clover XML format.\nThen there are some system, such as Phabricator, which have a custom format they expect.\nc.f. facebook/infer#673\nThe above probably doesnt fill 3 months.\nPulling the coala results from CI using this format could be a way to inform newbies of the style problems with their PRs.\nAnother way to expand this project is to also push the unit test results as XML to the CI (using combination XML files if necessary)","comments":5,"createdAt":"2018-04-17T11:07:57Z","updatedAt":"2019-02-01T05:46:26Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"li-boxuan","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/25746010?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"Project Proposal","color":"f9d0c4"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"projects","updatedAtMs":1548860895000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/projects/issues/616","number":616,"title":"2017 GSoC report activity yaml should be 1 based, not 0 based","body":"The yaml being submitted currently contains\nactivity:\n- 0:\n  - repo: name\n  - link: URL\n  - details: shortlog\n\nIt should be either 1 based, or be an array like\nactivity:\n\nrepo: name\nlink: URL\ndetails: shortlog\nrepo: name2\nlink: URL2\ndetails: shortlog2","comments":4,"createdAt":"2018-08-09T15:24:40Z","updatedAt":"2019-01-30T15:08:15Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"jennyjj","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/27842224?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"difficulty/low","color":"1d76db"},{"name":"importance/low","color":"2fe055"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"projects","updatedAtMs":1549038118000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/projects/issues/472","number":472,"title":"FAQ: Broken link in \"own project idea\"","body":"Link should be changed from https://github.com/coala/projects/blob/master/data/projects.js to https://github.com/coala/projects/blob/master/data/projects.liquid in this file.","comments":0,"createdAt":"2018-03-11T17:46:29Z","updatedAt":"2019-02-01T16:21:58Z","closedAt":"2019-02-01T16:21:58Z","state":"closed","user":{"login":null,"avatarUrl":null},"owner":{"login":null,"avatarUrl":null},"labels":[]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"projects","updatedAtMs":1549349172000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/projects/issues/477","number":477,"title":"README.md: Dont suggest sudo","body":"The README shouldnt require sudo.

We can improve the way it is managed by improving moban.\nYour point '3' is the only significant problem, and that can be solved by moban having patch support, so we can exclude the other code e.g. moremoban/moban#75 . A header can also be added using a patch.\nI am not worried about the licensing being missing from the file, as anyone modifying this file will likely be informed via code review, or will be reverted when someone looks at the moban job.  We should distribute the MIT license, and any other license of code we're including, but by no means is this \"substantial portions\" according to the MIT license so we're not breaking the license by not including it.  And by having a control file which mentions where code came from, and thus were the license text can be found, we're not hiding the fact the code is copied.\nThe fact it is unmaintained is a problem for the future, as PRs upstream will not get merged.  Again, a .patch could solve that, but i would expect that this type of code would be moved to a new coala-compat package, or something like that, or a sub-module of coala-utils.\nSame with the .coafile problems.  A patch can fix it.\nThe drawbacks of not doing it:\n\nanother piece of copied code will fade into the coala codebase and its history effectively lost\ncoala doesnt have a process for allowing externally written code into the repo.\nmoban doesnt have a user (coala) pushing for it to handle more complicated scenarios than just 'copy'.\ncoala doesnt start the process of identifying and fixing any existing copied code.  This one is MIT, but we will likely find some which isnt so freely licensed.  e.g. we have CC-BY-SA-licensed 'code' in some repos, and a major issue over in coala-quickstart\netc.\n\nBeing in .moban.yaml is an annoyance.

And for the bad commit message, I was trying it on my fork and I didn't realize that I did not amend the commit while i created the PR. I'll remember it next time.\n@sladyn98 IMHO Ignoring the warning didn't feel the best possible approach to the problem. I stand by my point that we should not ignore the errors only to make the build possible.\n@frextrite  As discussed above, I first used a r\" \" to wrap all the invalid sequences in it. But then I faced two problems with the above solution\n\nSphinx documentation doesn't recognize r\" \", and hence in the documentation, the sequences haven't been escaped rather they appeared as a string. eg:- (r\"/*\" appeared as r\"/*\", whereas it should detect the expression as only * after the netlify build of documentation) (I would be raising an issue there to inform about it soon)\nPycodestyle still emitted the warning of Invalid escape sequences\n\nThat's the reason why i did not use r to wrap the invalid sequences.\nAn alternative solution to the above problem was to use an extra backslash \\ before the sequence. This solved the above two problems. Sphinx perfectly detected a \\\\* as * and Pycodestyle didn't complain too.\nIMHO it is necessary to mention this somewhere in our documentation so that we don't encounter these errors in the future and cause build failures.","diffHunk":null,"author":{"login":"Naveenaidu","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/30195193?v=4","name":"Naveen Naidu"},"reactions":[],"createdAt":"2019-02-02T05:46:30Z","lastEditedAt":"2019-02-02T05:53:48Z","updatedAt":"2019-02-02T05:53:48Z"},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1OTk0Mjg0OQ==","url":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/pull/2848#issuecomment-459942849","bodyText":"Yeah @Naveenaidu your right but  I suggested ignoring because you suggested that we would have to make changes in four files,else in my original comment on gitter I said that adding an extra '\\' to avoid the escape sequences  error would be the best solution.Moreover @jayvdb mentioned in his orginal issue that sphinx would throw errors on r\" \"  wrapping ,my bad not to see that, anyways we would have to wait for the gometa linter issue to fixed for us to see the travis build and then proceed.Apart from that LGTM.","diffHunk":null,"author":{"login":"sladyn98","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/28837406?v=4","name":"Sladyn"},"reactions":[{"id":"MDg6UmVhY3Rpb24zNjMxNDMwMw==","createdAt":"2019-02-02T07:21:59Z","content":"THUMBS_UP","user":{"login":"Naveenaidu","name":"Naveen Naidu"}}],"createdAt":"2019-02-02T07:16:08Z","lastEditedAt":"2019-02-02T07:17:53Z","updatedAt":"2019-02-02T07:17:53Z"},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1OTk0MzM2MA==","url":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/pull/2848#issuecomment-459943360","bodyText":"Please manually run the CI, especially the sphinx-build bits, as were mentioned in #2760","diffHunk":null,"author":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4","name":"John Vandenberg"},"reactions":[],"createdAt":"2019-02-02T07:24:57Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2019-02-02T07:24:57Z"}]}}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala-bears","updatedAtMs":1549258773000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/pull/2850","number":2850,"title":".travis.yml: Update Golang version to 1.11.5","body":"Removed old golang repository links from .travis.yml\nSetup gimme to install the latest stable version of golang\nv1.11.5 available at the time of the change\nCloses #2843\n\nFor short term contributors: we understand that getting your commits well\ndefined like we require is a hard task and takes some learning.

The test file that this test use is here.\nThe appveryor fails because the test written at line 27\n  self.section.append(Setting('pylint_disable', ''))\n        self.check_invalidity(\n            self.uut,\n            [],  # Doesn't matter, pylint will parse the file\n            self.test_file)\n\nwhen run, should produce some output/error message. FYI the above test case adds line something like disable=  in the configuration filie, which basically means to disable no errors. But it seems like(from the appveyor error) that, pylint isn't producing any error message.\nIMHO I guess you should go through Pylint documentation and see what's causing this.","diffHunk":null,"author":{"login":"Naveenaidu","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/30195193?v=4","name":"Naveen Naidu"},"reactions":[{"id":"MDg6UmVhY3Rpb24zNDM4ODU3Ng==","createdAt":"2018-12-24T11:14:16Z","content":"THUMBS_UP","user":{"login":"shashank-b","name":"Shashank Batra"}}],"createdAt":"2018-12-24T10:02:54Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-12-24T10:02:54Z"},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1ODE3NDc0Mw==","url":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/pull/2828#issuecomment-458174743","bodyText":"Travis build is failing due to this issue #2843 so the build can't complete successfully until the issue is resolved.","diffHunk":null,"author":{"login":"Akhelesh","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/42298056?v=4","name":null},"reactions":[],"createdAt":"2019-01-28T15:26:04Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2019-01-28T15:26:04Z"},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MDQ5NzgzNw==","url":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/pull/2828#issuecomment-460497837","bodyText":"@Akhelesh would you please add a note on #2826 explaining what happens when an empty file is used for the rcfile .

Owing to this fact, in the custom_matcher defined in InvalidLinkBearTest.py at L42,request.url == URLHeadBear.check_connection_url would always return False since the value of original check_connection_url was defined to be http://216.58.218.174(Note: no forward-slash). Hence this condition would never be possible and the value of the status_code of the default connection url would always be None, though this behaviour was never intended.\nWhen the original test case for this was written, it was asserting True on the returned value of the output of URLHeadBear.check_prerequisites(). It would always return the error string You are not connected to the internet., and when asserting this return, the test would pass, incorrectly.\nTo overcome this, the test was modified in this commit, to assert for the returned string instead of the asserting True. This too was incorrect, since in the custom matcher the check_connection_url URL was explicitly defined(atleast intended) to return a status code of 200OK, but this line was never hit as mentioned in the first paragraph.\nHence URLHeadBear.check_prerequisites() while testing would always return the error string You are not connected to the internet. and hence as mentioned in the above commit, instead of changing the mock properties to actually return 200OK if the head request was to check_connection_url URL, the actual test case was modified to check against the error string which was never intended.","diffHunk":null,"author":{"login":"frextrite","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/29180487?v=4","name":"Amol Grover"},"createdAt":"2019-01-08T07:12:07Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2019-01-08T07:12:07Z"},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MzE1NTUxMA==","url":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/pull/2836#issuecomment-453155510","bodyText":"In my defense, I was sleepy when I made the commit","diffHunk":null,"author":{"login":"frextrite","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/29180487?v=4","name":"Amol Grover"},"createdAt":"2019-01-10T16:18:10Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2019-01-10T16:18:10Z"}]}}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala-bears","updatedAtMs":1549260401000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/pull/2837","number":2837,"title":"PySafetyBear.py: Adds Asciinema for PySafetyBear.","body":"Adds asciinema for PySafetyBear.\nPreviously, no asciinema was present in PySafetyBear.py file.\nAdds asciinema for PySafetyBear.\nFixes #2371\nFor short term contributors: we understand that getting your commits well\ndefined like we require is a hard task and takes some learning.

As soon as it encounters a control label(eg: for,if,set etc..), it appends those labels into the stack. Note that, we also maintain the end control label where ever necessary. Whenever an control tag is added and if it doesn't find it's endtag in the next line, The Indent step is increased. This is done, because if the endtag is not found on the nextline it basically means that we have nesting of instructions.\nEg:\n{% for tony in avengers %}\n{% for thanos in enemy %}\n{% set thanos == 'EVIL' %}\n{% endfor %}{# for thanos in enemy #}\n{% endfor %}{# for tony in avengers #}\n\nAs you see above after the first for, we do not have an endfor, that means we have a nesting in our Code. In such cases we append the first for in the stack. Now when it goes to the next line, it  checks if the next label matches the end label for the element present in the stack. That means, here we are checking if the next label is endfor. If it is then do nothing.\nIf it's not, then increase the Indent step , which is nothing but the number of spaces that has to be appended infront of a line. And check if the next line has that many number of indent steps. If not then create a diff.\nNow, when it encounters a endtag for the element present in the stack, it does two things\n\nDecreases the Indentaion Step\nPops out the element from the stack.\n\nThis is the basic working of the solution.\nThe above example get's indented as follows:\n{% for tony in avengers %}\n  {% for thanos in enemy %}\n    {% set thanos == 'EVIL' %}\n  {% endfor %}{# for thanos in enemy #}\n{% endfor %}{# for tony in avengers #}\n\nFor the cases where we have a code which has nested languages such as Jinja2 and Python. The lines from other languages are skipped. coala doesn't yet have the functionality to detect multiple languages.\nFor eg:\nimport sys\n{% for tony in avengers %}\n  {% for thanos in enemy %}\n                    print(\"Thanos Rocks!!\")\n          print(\"Testing Indentation\")\n{% set avengers = loose %}\n  {% endfor %}{# for thanos in enemy #}\n{% endfor %}{# for tony in avengers #}\n\nAfter the indentation, it would look like\n{% for tony in avengers %}\n  {% for thanos in enemy %}\n                   print(\"Thanos Rocks!!\")\n          print(\"Testing Indentation\")\n     {% set avengers = loose %}\n  {% endfor %}{# for thanos in enemy #}\n{% endfor %}{# for tony in avengers #}\n\nAs you see above, we provide no indentation to both the print statements. We just ignore them.","diffHunk":null,"author":{"login":"Naveenaidu","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/30195193?v=4","name":"Naveen Naidu"},"createdAt":"2019-02-04T18:25:08Z","lastEditedAt":"2019-02-04T18:31:45Z","updatedAt":"2019-02-04T18:31:45Z"}]}}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala-bears","updatedAtMs":1548842067000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/pull/2811","number":2811,"title":"HgCommitBear.py: Add asciinema.","body":"Fixes: #2739\n\nChecklist\n\n I read the commit guidelines and I've followed\nthem.\n I ran coala over my code locally.

Take pyre_bad.py:2 for example.\n    return 'string'\npyre says the error happens on line 2, column 4.\nNow the problem comes:\nWhat is column 4? Is the first column numbered 0 or 1?\nBack to our example. It is clear that there are 4 spaces before return. Very likely, they consider the position of the first character of return, as the error position, i.e. the position of r. They call this position column 4. If that is the case, we can infer that they count column numbers from 0. However, coala counts from 1. column 4 needs to be converted into column 5 in coala.\nBut I am not sure. I don't know how they come up with column 4. Maybe they are referring to the last space before the word return, but chances are small. Maybe they have inconsistencies/bugs within their tool. You need to look up in their documentation (or even code), or ask them in their community.\nIt might not be an easy task, but such 'tiny' thing is important. coala needs to be accurate: sometimes upstream linters are not accurate, and we detect problems and help solve them.\nLet me know if my words are not clear enough 😉","diffHunk":"@@ -0,0 +1,65 @@\n+import os\n+import unittest\n+from queue import Queue\n+\n+from bears.python.PyreBear import PyreBear\n+from coalib.testing.BearTestHelper import generate_skip_decorator\n+from coalib.settings.Section import Section\n+\n+\n+def get_absolute_test_path(file):\n+    return os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__),\n+                        'pyre_test_files', file)\n+\n+\n+@generate_skip_decorator(PyreBear)\n+class PyreBearTest(unittest.TestCase):\n+\n+    def setUp(self):\n+        self.section = Section('pyre')\n+        self.queue = Queue()\n+        test_folder = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__),\n+                                   'pyre_test_files')\n+        self.test_good_file = os.path.join(test_folder,\n+                                           'pyre_test_good/pyre_good.py')\n+        self.test_bad_file = os.path.join(test_folder,\n+                                          'pyre_test_bad/pyre_bad.py')\n+\n+    def get_results(self, file):\n+        file_dict = {}\n+        with open(file, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as content:\n+            file_dict[file] = tuple(content.readlines())\n+        self.uut = PyreBear(file_dict,\n+                            self.section,\n+                            self.queue)\n+        if self.uut.run_bear_from_section([], {}) is None:\n+            return []\n+        return list(self.uut.run_bear_from_section([], {}))\n+\n+    def test_results(self):\n+        # Test Bad File\n+        results = self.get_results(self.test_bad_file)\n+        # Check Result Message(s)\n+        messages = [result.message for result in results]\n+        self.assertEqual(len(messages), 2)\n+        self.assertEqual(messages[0], 'Incompatible return type [7]: '\n+                         'Expected `int` but got `str`.')\n+        self.assertEqual(messages[1], 'Incompatible return type [7]: '\n+                         'Expected `str` but got `int`.')\n+        # Check Result Lines & Columns\n+        lines = [result.affected_code[0] for result in results]\n+        # For Message #1\n+        self.assertEqual(lines[0].end.column, 4)","author":{"login":"li-boxuan","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/25746010?v=4","name":"Boxuan Li"},"reactions":[{"id":"MDg6UmVhY3Rpb24zNDEzOTIzNg==","createdAt":"2018-12-18T12:44:18Z","content":"THUMBS_UP","user":{"login":"atb00ker","name":"Ajay Tripathi"}}],"createdAt":"2018-12-18T12:30:00Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-12-18T12:30:00Z"},{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDI0MzIzNDkxMA==","url":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/pull/2689#discussion_r243234910","bodyText":"Oh, yes, it's clear now, thank you. 😄\nIndeed, pyre is using 0-based offset for column and 1-based offset for row.\nThat should not be a problem, we can take the output from pyre and add 1 to column.
