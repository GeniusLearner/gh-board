type annotations to bears","body":"This can be performed in 3 ways:\n\nUsing the contracts module\nUsing python default type hinting\nManually checking using decorators or the bears run() or create_arguments() method.\n\nUsing contracts\nWe we need custom checks for settings which only accept a discrete set of values. The only option seems to follow is use custom contract type eg.\nnew_contract('valid_name', lambda s: isinstance(s, str) and len(s)>0)\n@contract(names='dict(int: (valid_name, int))')\ndef process_accounting(records):\n    ...\n\nThe problem occurring over here is the function name provided to the new_contract method gets the value of the argument implicitly as the one and only argument. Since this doesn't even receive the self or any other kind of variable its impossible to access other objects from inside this method which means we can't populate a class for storing metadata of the acceptable set of values and unless we modify contracts itself or define the acceptable set of values in the function itself. When defining the acceptable values in the function itself it is impossible to access those values outside the method thus defeating the purpose. contracts also follows a strict syntax which makes it impossible to predefine a custom set of methods for each kind of setting in the base classes to which the actual bear can just pass the acceptable values and the setting list to compare against. Everything needs to be implemented in each bear itself. Summing up things like\n[new_contract(i, lambda s: isinstance(s, str) and len(s)>0) for i in in setting_list]\n\nalso doesn't work which makes the code much more difficult to read. The usage of contracts module also provides difficulty when the some default values of the bear setting are assumed in case of the value to the setting is not provided or invalid value is given.\nUsing Type hints provided by python\nThese are pretty much worthless. They can be only used for documentation purposes unless the type checking is performed specially with loading the mypy module which just checks for type hint inconsistencies and doesn't actually run the program. (Haven't tested this out with custom classes). Normal runs of the code don't point out any inconsistencies in invalid types according to type hints.\nWriting code and manual checks for each setting in some way or the other\nThis should be the last resort unless an elegant way is devised. Can be done using decorators or the bear code is itself but a common set of classnames have to be come upon which will be used by all the bears to extract out information about these settings. This can be performed by adding classes to the base class and asking the bear writers to fill them up. Functions can also be made in the base classes to test out settings to automatically provide just the setting and the default values, calling the correct function for the correct setting type and checking whether the value provided is valid or not.","comments":16,"createdAt":"2018-06-10T06:59:58Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-11T05:42:56Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"ishanSrt","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/29859362?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"ishanSrt","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/29859362?v=4"},"labels":[]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala-bears","updatedAtMs":1535890821000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/issues/2554","number":2554,"title":"Coala website languages section is empty","body":"I tried to visit https://coala.io/#/languages because the old docs seem to be unmaintained (https://github.com/coala/bear-docs/).\nHowever, the search box seems to not be wired up.

The mapping isnt exact, but the benefits of using the test result format is tight integration with various system.\nCircleCI can accept this format: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/collect-test-data/\nAppVeyor can receive a test results XML format, in the format output by xunit, presumably the same as JUnit.\nhttps://www.appveyor.com/docs/running-tests/#uploading-xml-test-results\nThe first project phase could involve converting the JSON to JUnit format and uploading into Circle CI and Appveyor.\nThe JUnit format should also be tested with a Jenkins install, to ensure it is uploading correctly there.  This would mean our Jenkins project is much less important.\nAnother common format is TAP.\nAnd there is Clover XML format.\nThen there are some system, such as Phabricator, which have a custom format they expect.\nc.f. facebook/infer#673\nThe above probably doesnt fill 3 months.\nPulling the coala results from CI using this format could be a way to inform newbies of the style problems with their

necessary)","comments":3,"createdAt":"2018-04-17T11:07:57Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-10T16:21:54Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"Project

Add handlers for `ARGS` and `ARGUMENTS` and provide the functionality\n+   of partial code analysis in `pyflakes`.\n+7. Create a `PEP8NamingBear` that detects all pep8 naming violations\n+   in a python file. Special handling is also done to detect violations\n+   in doctests which other similar plugins fail to perform.\n+8. Create a `BuiltinsBear` that is capable of detecting redefinition\n+   of python builtins in a file.\n+\n+\n+#### Challenges\n+\n+The challenge of the project was to implement the `PyFlakesASTBear` in\n+such a way that a plugin developer need not worry about writing his own\n+traversing logic and need to have much no more than the knowledge of\n+PyFlakesASTBear nodes to write the bears. However, designing the logic\n+first by writing cEP(coala enhancement proposal) for\n+[coala-pyflakes](https://github.com/coala/cEPs/blob/master/cEP-0025.md) helped\n+me a lot to understand the problem to a deep level and come out with a logic\n+to tackle it.\n+\n+#### Future prospects of the projects\n+\n+With `PyFlakesASTBear` ready bear developers can use it to detect codesmells","author":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4","name":"John Vandenberg"},"createdAt":"2018-08-09T15:37:50Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-08-09T15:37:50Z"},{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDIwOTAyMjkzMw==","url":"https://github.com/coala/projects/pull/614#discussion_r209022933","bodyText":"Use quotes or : will be treated as defining yaml variable","diffHunk":"@@ -0,0 +1,305 @@\n+---\n+layout: report\n+permalink: /GSoC/2018/StatusReport/macbox7\n+student: Ankit Joshi\n+organisation: coala\n+organisation_link: https://coala.io\n+project: Integrate pyflakes-enhanced AST into coala\n+project_link: https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5549789140221952\n+tarball: https://rawgit.com/MacBox7/GSoC-Report/master/project.tar.gz\n+mentors: >\n+ [John Vandenberg](https://github.com/jayvdb) & [Adhika Setya Pramudita](https://github.com/adhikasp) & [Steven Myint](https://github.com/myint)\n+\n+phase:\n+ - Bonding : https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/GSoC-2018/milestones/8\n+ - Phase 1 : https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/GSoC-2018/milestones/25\n+ - Phase 2 : https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/GSoC-2018/milestones/26\n+ - Phase 3 : https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/GSoC-2018/milestones/27\n+\n+bio: >\n+  A senior student at National Institute Of Technology, Kurukshetra major\n+  in Information Technology.

For GSoC, I worked on\n+  [coala-pyflakes](https://gitlab.com/coala/bears/coala-pyflakes) and\n+  [pyflakes](https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes). The project was to\n+  integrate pyflakes-enhanced AST into coala as a metabear which was\n+  then used to develop various plugins. The second part of the project\n+  was to write plugin bears using the developed `PyFlakesASTBear`.\n+\n+social:\n+  - GitHub:\n+    - username: macbox7\n+    - link: https://github.com/macbox7\n+  -

I chose coala for my GSoC project\n+  because I think it's awesome to be able to push my friends a friendly reminder\n+  to indent their code properly, and programmatically detect when they went lazy\n+  in doing so, which helps me to focus on the main logic when working on a team\n+  project.\n+social:\n+  - GitHub:\n+    - username: virresh\n+    - link: https://github.com/virresh\n+  - GitLab:\n+    - username: virresh\n+    - link: https://gitlab.com/virresh\n+  - Gitter:\n+    - username: virresh\n+    - link: https://gitter.im/virresh\n+  - Openhub:\n+    - username: virresh\n+    - link: https://www.openhub.net/accounts/virresh\n+email: viresh16118@iiitd.ac.in\n+blog: https://virresh.wordpress.com/\n+activity:\n+  - 1:\n+      - repo: cEPs\n+      - link: https://github.com/coala/cEPs/commit/49c6cec2\n+      - details: >\n+          \"cEP-0018: Integration of ANTLR in coala\"\n+  - 2:\n+      - repo: cEPs\n+      - link: https://github.com/coala/cEPs/commit/b8a17299\n+      - details: >\n+          \"cEP-0018.md: Add information about fixes\"\n+  - 3:\n+      - repo: coala-antlr\n+      - link: https://gitlab.com/coala/bears/coala-antlr/commit/f51addcf\n+      - details: >\n+          \"Initial Commit\"","author":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4","name":"John Vandenberg"},"reactions":[],"createdAt":"2018-08-13T07:20:49Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-08-13T07:20:49Z"},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMTk5NTAyNg==","url":"https://github.com/coala/projects/pull/617#issuecomment-411995026","bodyText":"https://deploy-preview-617--coala-projects.netlify.com/gsoc/2018/statusreport/virresh","diffHunk":null,"author":{"login":"virresh","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10978108?v=4","name":"Viresh Gupta"},"reactions":[],"createdAt":"2018-08-10T07:04:47Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-08-10T07:04:47Z"}]}}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"projects","updatedAtMs":1534044581000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/projects/pull/618","number":618,"title":"reports: Add li-boxuan's GSoC report","body":"https://deploy-preview-618--coala-projects.netlify.com/gsoc/2018/statusreport/li-boxuan","comments":18,"createdAt":"2018-08-10T15:10:22Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-12T03:29:41Z","closedAt":"2018-08-12T03:28:16Z","state":"merged","user":{"login":"li-boxuan","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/25746010?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"li-boxuan","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/25746010?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"process/pending review","color":"bfe5bf"},{"name":"size/M","color":"ededed"}],"pullRequest":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/projects/pull/618","comments":[{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDIwOTM5NjYxNw==","url":"https://github.com/coala/projects/pull/618#discussion_r209396617","bodyText":"I think you have to add a report_year variable as well","diffHunk":"@@ -0,0 +1,356 @@\n+---\n+layout: report\n+permalink: /GSoC/2018/StatusReport/li-boxuan","author":{"login":"hemangsk","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/13018570?v=4","name":"Hemang Kumar"},"reactions":[{"id":"MDg6UmVhY3Rpb24yNzc4MzA3Mw==","createdAt":"2018-08-11T04:31:24Z","content":"THUMBS_UP","user":{"login":"li-boxuan","name":"Boxuan Li"}}],"createdAt":"2018-08-10T22:14:57Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-08-10T22:14:57Z"},{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDIwOTQxNzU5OQ==","url":"https://github.com/coala/projects/pull/618#discussion_r209417599","bodyText":"start at 1\nalso this is yaml, which has two space indents","diffHunk":"@@ -0,0 +1,357 @@\n+---\n+layout: report\n+permalink: /GSoC/2018/StatusReport/li-boxuan\n+student: Boxuan Li\n+organisation: coala\n+organisation_link : https://coala.io\n+report_year: 2018\n+project: Meta-review\n+project_link: https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5188493739819008\n+tarball: https://github.com/li-boxuan/GSoCReport/raw/master/li-boxuan_coala.tar\n+mentors: >\n+ [Hemang Kumar](https://github.com/hemangsk/) &\n+ [Surya Widi](https://github.com/blazeu) &\n+ [Andrew Dassonville](https://github.com/andrewda)\n+phase:\n+ - Bonding : https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/GSoC-2018/milestones/14\n+ - Phase 1 : https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/GSoC-2018/milestones/15\n+ - Phase 2 : https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/GSoC-2018/milestones/16\n+ - Phase 3 : https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/GSoC-2018/milestones/17\n+bio: >\n+  I am a final year student (expected graduation date: May 2019) of Computer\n+  Science at The University of Hong Kong.

details: >\n+     Generate a fake api similar to coala's webservices\n+\n+### Newcomer Metrics and Gamification\n+\n+This project is about automating the recognition of activities performed by people\n+who join the coala community, and encourage them to progress towards obtaining the\n+role of \"Developer\" in the community.\n+\n+This project incorporated a gamification system which allows us to track the progress\n+of newcomers activities and assign some points to each of the activities they do.\n+The newcomers will get some score which will be the sum of all the points they have\n+earned by performing several activities. The score they get will be a deciding factor\n+for the current 'Level' of the newcomer and the activities they perform will be a\n+deciding factor for 'Badges' they have earned.\n+\n+coala always tries to be a welcoming organization for newcomers, giving them clear\n+pathways and as much direct assistance as possible. However, it is already known that\n+newcomers face many barriers while attempting to contribute to open source for the\n+first time, and additional barriers while attempting to contribute to projects run\n+by the coala organization. On the other hand, gamification is widely used to engage\n+and motivate people to accomplish tasks and improve their performance.\n+\n+Thus, the goal of this project is to use gamification to orient and motivate newcomers\n+to overcome onboarding barriers to contribute and engage with coala and its community.\n+\n+#### Work Done\n+\n+##### Creating the APIs\n+\n+To build the gamification app, there was a need of constant data supply of all the\n+activities newcomers do, i.e. Getting a pull request merge, Creating an issue and\n+sending messages to the gitter channels. The work to achieve the same has been done\n+in the [webservices](https://gitlab.com/coala/landing/) repo.

details: >\n+     Generate a fake api similar to coala's webservices\n+\n+### Newcomer Metrics and Gamification\n+\n+This project is about automating the recognition of activities performed by people\n+who join the coala community, and encourage them to progress towards obtaining the\n+role of \"Developer\" in the community.\n+\n+This project incorporated a gamification system which allows us to track the progress\n+of newcomers activities and assign some points to each of the activities they do.\n+The newcomers will get some score which will be the sum of all the points they have\n+earned by performing several activities. The score they get will be a deciding factor\n+for the current 'Level' of the newcomer and the activities they perform will be a\n+deciding factor for 'Badges' they have earned.\n+\n+coala always tries to be a welcoming organization for newcomers, giving them clear\n+pathways and as much direct assistance as possible. However, it is already known that\n+newcomers face many barriers while attempting to contribute to open source for the\n+first time, and additional barriers while attempting to contribute to projects run\n+by the coala organization. On the other hand, gamification is widely used to engage\n+and motivate people to accomplish tasks and improve their performance.\n+\n+Thus, the goal of this project is to use gamification to orient and motivate newcomers\n+to overcome onboarding barriers to contribute and engage with coala and its community.\n+\n+#### Work Done\n+\n+##### Creating the APIs\n+\n+To build the gamification app, there was a need of constant data supply of all the\n+activities newcomers do, i.e. Getting a pull request merge, Creating an issue and\n+sending messages to the gitter channels. The work to achieve the same has been done\n+in the [webservices](https://gitlab.com/coala/landing/) repo. And the output of all\n+the script can be viewed at [webservices.coala.io](https://github.com/sks444/webservices.coala.io/commit/9d263725092f2ab18fde84fb46dececc95d2a76d) which is a workaround to get a fixed\n+URL for all the APIs until there is the integration of continuous deployment in the webservices.\n+\n+##### Building the Gamification system\n+\n+The second and the important part of my work, from [importing the useful newcomers data](https://github.com/coala/community/commit/537602ecbe67263a1c3a877f88444ec6620190f4)","author":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4","name":"John Vandenberg"},"reactions":[],"createdAt":"2018-08-11T11:12:29Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-08-11T11:12:29Z"},{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDIwOTQyNDI4Mw==","url":"https://github.com/coala/projects/pull/619#discussion_r209424283","bodyText":"80cpl","diffHunk":"@@ -0,0 +1,246 @@\n+---\n+layout: report\n+permalink: /GSoC/2018/StatusReport/ShrikrishnaSingh\n+student: Shrikrishna Singh\n+organisation: coala\n+organisation_link : https://coala.io\n+project: Newcomer metrics and gamification\n+project_link: https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5892040252981248\n+tarball: https://github.com/sks444/GSoC-18-Patches/raw/master/project.tar.gz\n+mentors: >\n+ [John Vandenberg](http://github.com/jayvdb),\n+ [Pranav Dixit](https://github.com/prnvdixit),\n+ [Andrew Dassonville](https://github.com/andrewda) &\n+ [Gopala](https://github.com/gkrishnan724)\n+phase:\n+ - Bonding : <https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/GSoC-2018/milestones/2>\n+ - Phase 1 : <https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/GSoC-2018/milestones/19>\n+ - Phase 2 : <https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/GSoC-2018/milestones/43>\n+ - Phase 3 : <https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/GSoC-2018/milestones/44>\n+bio: >\n+ I am a final year Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate at\n+ Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University.

Improved I/O mechanism for coala.\n+   1. Added a class `FileFactory` to interface with files and to provide file\n+      contents in different forms like string, binary data or as a tuple.\n+   2. Added a `Directory` class to interface with directories and provide\n+      useful information about them such as the directory path, parent\n+      directory and timestamps. This will be later used to implement ignore\n+      directories functionality.\n+   3. Added documentation for `FileFactory` and improved the NextGen-Core\n+      docs.\n+\n+2. Caching support.\n+   1. Cached the properties of `FileFactory` which turned out to be a\n+      significant performance boost in consecutive coala runs.\n+   2. Added support for unordered collection types in `persistent_hash`\n+      which improved the NextGen-Core's ability to hash much more\n+      complex task objects (which are used in NextGen caching).\n+\n+3. Integrated `FileFactory` with the core.\n+   1. Added line endings support for `FileFactory`.\n+   2. Implemented a middleware `FileDict` that mimics a dictionary\n+      and provides the bears in the old core with the actual file\n+      contents instead of the `FileFactory` objects thereby maintaining\n+      backwards compatibility with the old core.\n+   3. Modified the tests to use actual files and the `FileFactory` objects\n+      instead of hard-coded file contents.\n+\n+#### Challenges\n+\n+One of the first challenges I faced was designing the `FileFactory`.\n+But with my mentors help we were able to come up with a design that\n+could be used for the NextGen-Core and also maintained compatibility\n+with the old core.\n+\n+The biggest challenge that I faced these three months for the integration\n+of the aforementioned `FileFactory` with the core. Initially about thirty\n+tests were failing but after discussing the idea of using a middleware\n+(`FileDict`) to maintain backwards compatibilty with the old core the test\n+failures were significantly reduced to just six. After a while I discovered\n+that `FileFactory` was somehow removing line-endings from the file contents\n+which was fixed by adding support for newlines in `FileFactory` which in turn\n+led to a successful integration.\n+\n+#### Work to be done\n+\n+Two major features were left out because of time constraints:\n+1. Ignore directories functionality for the NextGen-Core.\n+2. Cache control flags for the NextGen-Core (which was\n+   already mentioned as a stretch issue in my GSoC proposal).\n+\n+I have started the work on implementing the cache control flags and will","author":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4","name":"John Vandenberg"},"reactions":[{"id":"MDg6UmVhY3Rpb24yNzgxNjUyMQ==","createdAt":"2018-08-13T06:22:36Z","content":"THUMBS_UP","user":{"login":"palash25","name":"Palash Nigam"}}],"createdAt":"2018-08-13T01:11:13Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-08-13T01:11:13Z"},{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDIwOTQ3NTU5Mw==","url":"https://github.com/coala/projects/pull/635#discussion_r209475593","bodyText":"missing ;-)","diffHunk":"@@ -0,0 +1,187 @@\n+---\n+categories:\n+  - GSoC\n+  - 2018\n+  - StatusReport\n+report_year: 2018\n+date: 2018-08-12\n+student: Palash Nigam\n+organisation: coala\n+organisation_link: https://coala.io\n+project: Optimize Caching for the NextGen-Core\n+project_link: https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6434190552203264\n+tarball: ","author":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4","name":"John Vandenberg"},"reactions":[],"createdAt":"2018-08-13T01:11:27Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-08-13T01:11:27Z"},{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDIwOTUyNjI1OQ==","url":"https://github.com/coala/projects/pull/635#discussion_r209526259","bodyText":"14 patches vs 15 activities.... ?","diffHunk":"@@ -0,0 +1,184 @@\n+---\n+categories:\n+  - GSoC\n+  - 2018\n+  - StatusReport\n+report_year: 2018\n+date: 2018-08-12\n+student: Palash Nigam\n+organisation: coala\n+organisation_link: https://coala.io\n+project: Optimize Caching for the NextGen-Core\n+project_link: https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6434190552203264\n+tarball: https://rawgit.com/palash25/gsoc-18-report/master/project.tar.gz\n+sha256sum: 0af1551d96663f82c5ccf05437008ba00fade628a5a1659bdb78364b3546caf4\n+mentors: >\n+  [Mischa Krüger](https://github.com/Makman2),\n+  [Shreyans Doshi](https://github.com/shreyans800755),\n+  [Fabian Neuschmidt](https://github.com/fneu)\n+phase:\n+  - Bonding: https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/GSoC-2018/milestones/32\n+  - Phase 1: https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/GSoC-2018/milestones/33\n+  - Phase 2: https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/GSoC-2018/milestones/34\n+  - Phase 3: https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/GSoC-2018/milestones/35\n+bio: >\n+  I am second year student of B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering at\n+  International Institute of Information and Technology, Bhubaneswar,\n+  Odisha, India.
