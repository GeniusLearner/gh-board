It is therefore only able to identify code that is definitely not tested.\nThe most extreme examples of the problem are tests with no assertions. Fortunately these are uncommon in most code bases. Much more common is code that is only partially tested by its suite. A suite that only partially tests code can still execute all its branches (examples).\nAs it is actually able to detect whether each statement is meaningfully tested, mutation testing is the gold standard against which all other types of coverage are measured.\n\nAs far as I am concerned, checkstyle community uses mutation testing, which seems to be quite powerful.\nSee available mutation testing tools for python: https://github.com/theofidry/awesome-mutation-testing Unfortunately, none of them is very popular, and I have no idea how well they work.","comments":3,"createdAt":"2019-03-27T15:15:20Z","updatedAt":"2019-04-07T07:36:35Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"li-boxuan","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/25746010?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"li-boxuan","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/25746010?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"Project Proposal","color":"f9d0c4"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"projects","updatedAtMs":1553706669000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/projects/issues/723","number":723,"title":"\"use_spaces\" setting missing in html section","body":"Running coala over this repository raises a prompt error asking for \"use_spaces\" setting which shouldn't happen!","comments":3,"createdAt":"2019-03-21T17:31:16Z","updatedAt":"2019-03-27T17:11:09Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"KVGarg","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/35761292?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"KVGarg","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/35761292?v=4"},"labels":[]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"projects","updatedAtMs":1553619057000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/projects/issues/725","number":725,"title":"GSoD: A new open-source program","body":"Google recently announced new open-source program, Google Season of Docs (GSoD) which is similar to current GSoC but its just all about documentation.

Everything there holds true for this one, just that this one is for api.coala.io instead of docs.coala.io.\nThis would make a nice newcomer issue. Once one of them is solved, the person can follow the same process to solve the other one.\nOverview Description\nThe coala header in https://api.coala.io/en/latest/ gets scaled only horizontally when viewed using mobile browsers leading to a distortion of the logo. It would be better if the consistency of the logo is maintained.\nSteps to Reproduce\nOpen https://api.coala.io/en/latest/ in any mobile web browser (portrait mode)\nActual Results\n\nExpected Results\nIf the image scales while preserving aspect ratio and is aligned to the center or to the left, the logo would remain round.","comments":6,"createdAt":"2019-01-10T09:30:34Z","updatedAt":"2019-04-15T17:21:39Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"shashank-b","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/22676390?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"shashank-b","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/22676390?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"difficulty/newcomer","color":"0e8a16"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"landing-frontend","updatedAtMs":1554125189000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/landing-frontend/issues/293","number":293,"title":"Add an option of search in dropdown so that no need of sliding to search language ","body":"","comments":4,"createdAt":"2018-11-20T20:31:55Z","updatedAt":"2019-04-01T13:26:29Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"pandeynandancse","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/22164926?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"pandeynandancse","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/22164926?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"difficulty/newcomer","color":"0e8a16"},{"name":"type/bug","color":"ee0701"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"landing-frontend","updatedAtMs":1555350347000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/landing-frontend/issues/268","number":268,"title":"Add fork-me ribbon","body":"","comments":8,"createdAt":"2018-03-22T14:34:22Z","updatedAt":"2019-04-15T17:45:47Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"sangamcse","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/26381717?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"sangamcse","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/26381717?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"difficulty/low","color":"1d76db"},{"name":"needs-discussion","color":"aa52aa"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala","updatedAtMs":1555870663000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/pull/6015","number":6015,"title":"Fix EOF error","body":"When running coala with -A or --single-action flag,\nthe program will exit 1 if user pressing Ctrl + D.\nNow, the program will exit 0.\nFixes #6003\n\nFor short term contributors: we understand that getting your commits well\ndefined like we require is a hard task and takes some learning.

Implementing major features usually happens from a technical perspective and may lead to poorly designed content - developer and user wise. This can essentially save a lot of coding work and also makes sure that major features are properly documented.\n+\n+Experience tells us that the best GSoC students are the ones who heavily contributed to the project ideas website, created projects from the issues, and expanded on existing ***.md*** files.\n+\n+So, if you are planning to do GSoC with coala, you should be starting to write detailed project ideas in our [projects](https://github.com/coala/projects) repository. Also, you should learn how to express complex technical ideas in the markup because if you can't explain your idea, and how you will achieve it, we probably won't be able to mentor you.","author":{"login":"KVGarg","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/35761292?v=4","name":"Keshav Garg"},"reactions":[],"createdAt":"2018-12-03T09:43:20Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-12-03T09:43:20Z"},{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDIzOTIxNzQ1Mg==","url":"https://github.com/coala/projects/pull/693#discussion_r239217452","bodyText":"please remove the unnecessary whitespaces at the start of line 6, 7, 15, 16, 19, 20, 21, 22","diffHunk":"@@ -0,0 +1,25 @@\n+---\n+question: \"What is a cEP and why it is so important to do analysis pre-gsoc and\n+ design as early as possible, to be finalized in the cEP?\"\n+---\n+A **cEP (coala Enhancement Proposal)** is proposed to the coala community to\n+ discuss the new major features that the contributor intends to implement during","author":{"login":"palash25","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/21367710?v=4","name":"Palash Nigam"},"reactions":[{"id":"MDg6UmVhY3Rpb24zMzUxMzc0OA==","createdAt":"2018-12-05T21:36:21Z","content":"THUMBS_UP","user":{"login":"KVGarg","name":"Keshav Garg"}}],"createdAt":"2018-12-05T20:02:16Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-12-05T20:02:16Z"},{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDIzOTI0OTgyOA==","url":"https://github.com/coala/projects/pull/693#discussion_r239249828","bodyText":"Actually, when I separated a long line to multiple lines, that whitespace at the starting of each line came up when I pressed enter key after a certain a word and that whitespace at beginning of sentence was actually the space between any two words, say between to and discuss.
