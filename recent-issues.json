Leaderboard\n\nAddition of a new column named issues that will show all the labels of issues that user has solved.\nAddition of a Search bar where a user can search any username in case there is a long record displayed on the page and a filter option can also be provided where the user wants to view a set of records according to his needs.\nIf possible, we can add a new column in leaderboard which will display the total time taken by the user to solve all the issues that were assigned to him.\nInstead of displaying activities on the leaderboard page we can show these activities on the profile page (to be created) as it will save space on the leaderboard page and we can accumulate more data and columns.\nFiltering of records between GCI participants and NON-GCI participants.\n(Thinking on) Changing static website to dynamic website because the records of users are not static they change with time as they gain new skills, solve new issues, no more a GCI participant as they are have grown up etc.\n\n\n\nHomepage\n\nWe can show up a leaderboard that shows up top 10 contributors of the current month(a drop-down having options with the weekly, monthly or yearly view) and NON-GCI and GCI participants will have a separate leaderboard, will have a drop-down option.\n\n\n\nAdd Login/Sign-up using GitHub\n\n\nCreate Profile Page\n\nRequirements: User should be logged in using GitHub\nDisplay all user related information and stats like it's rank, issues solved by that user, graph, contribution details and many more.\n\n\n\nUser\n\nIf possible, we can store the contribution details of users i.e. how much a user has contributed to which repository/community more and we can display that data on the graph or in some other format.\nIn Leaderboard, we can set username a hyperlink which will link to a profile page of the user(to be created).\n\n\n\nImprovements\n\n\nGamification Leaderboard\n\nDisplay all rendered results in a table format because currently the results are shown in a paragraph format\nTo make it more creative, we can show some medals/badge emojis based on data in badges columns and show these emoji beside the username.\n\n\n\nUI\n\nRe-designing of the website and making it responsive so that it looks good on different devices.\nIn Inactive Issue and unassigned issues activity web pages, instead of showing just JSON they should be displayed in proper format with some extra important information.\nContributors and Meta-Review data web pages should be redesignedto make it look good.\n\n\n\nImprovements and Enhancements in projects website\nEnhancements\n\nIn reference to project proposal #394\n\nCurrently, the website shows all projects together (Completed, Disabled and Open projects). Instead of showing them together we can group this projects so that user can easily navigate to any section.\nA new section can be added that can show the count of grouped projects(e.g. their x open projects, y disabled projects and z completed projects).\nAlso, IMO we can show stats of projects like how many new projects proposals were accepted out which how many were completed and compare it with previous years data. (Thinking more on it if it can be more enhanced).\nSince coala provides a linter for the code so we can provide information on how a particular completed project will benefit other orgs. And how they can use them in there code maintenance.\nPENDING: Requirement analysis of other GSoC and GCI Orgs.\n\n\n\nImprovements\n\nUI\n\nAdd UI to reports page that lists all previous year GSOC project.\nImprove UI of user reports page.\nThe responsive view looks to ugly need to be improved and materialize.css should be replaced by bootstrap.\nLanguage drop-down at the bottom of the page doesn't seem to be working so either it should be removed or add some functionality to implement that language changer of the page.\n\n\n\nExtension to GSoC 2018 project with  new additions and in reference to project proposal.","comments":1,"createdAt":"2018-11-17T13:27:07Z","updatedAt":"2018-12-25T06:44:24Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"KVGarg","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/35761292?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"KVGarg","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/35761292?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"Project Proposal","color":"f9d0c4"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"projects","updatedAtMs":1547443783000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/projects/issues/695","number":695,"title":"Enhance coala-html and integrate into coala core","body":"https://github.com/coala/coala-html is a nice project, but it is an angular application which limits its user scenario and popularity.

Owing to this fact, in the custom_matcher defined in InvalidLinkBearTest.py at L42,request.url == URLHeadBear.check_connection_url would always return False since the value of original check_connection_url was defined to be http://216.58.218.174(Note: no forward-slash). Hence this condition would never be possible and the value of the status_code of the default connection url would always be None, though this behaviour was never intended.\nWhen the original test case for this was written, it was asserting True on the returned value of the output of URLHeadBear.check_prerequisites(). It would always return the error string You are not connected to the internet., and when asserting this return, the test would pass, incorrectly.\nTo overcome this, the test was modified in this commit, to assert for the returned string instead of the asserting True. This too was incorrect, since in the custom matcher the check_connection_url URL was explicitly defined(atleast intended) to return a status code of 200OK, but this line was never hit as mentioned in the first paragraph.\nHence URLHeadBear.check_prerequisites() while testing would always return the error string You are not connected to the internet. and hence as mentioned in the above commit, instead of changing the mock properties to actually return 200OK if the head request was to check_connection_url URL, the actual test case was modified to check against the error string which was never intended.","diffHunk":null,"author":{"login":"frextrite","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/29180487?v=4","name":"Amol Grover"},"createdAt":"2019-01-08T07:12:07Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2019-01-08T07:12:07Z"},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MzE1NTUxMA==","url":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/pull/2836#issuecomment-453155510","bodyText":"In my defense, I was sleepy when I made the commit","diffHunk":null,"author":{"login":"frextrite","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/29180487?v=4","name":"Amol Grover"},"createdAt":"2019-01-10T16:18:10Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2019-01-10T16:18:10Z"}]}}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala-bears","updatedAtMs":1547879576000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/pull/2837","number":2837,"title":"PySafetyBear.py: Adds Asciinema for PySafetyBear.","body":"Adds asciinema for PySafetyBear.\nPreviously, no asciinema was present in PySafetyBear.py file.\nAdds asciinema for PySafetyBear.\nFixes #2371\nFor short term contributors: we understand that getting your commits well\ndefined like we require is a hard task and takes some learning.
