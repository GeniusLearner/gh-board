Instead of showing them together we can group this projects so that user can easily navigate to any section.\nA new section can be added that can show the count of grouped projects(e.g. their x open projects, y disabled projects and z completed projects).\nAlso, IMO we can show stats of projects like how many new projects proposals were accepted out which how many were completed and compare it with previous years data. (Thinking more on it if it can be more enhanced).\nSince coala provides a linter for the code so we can provide information on how a particular completed project will benefit other orgs.

Header's aspect ratio not consistent (in mobile browsers)","body":"This issue is very similar to #299. Everything there holds true for this one, just that this one is for api.coala.io instead of docs.coala.io.\nThis would make a nice newcomer issue. Once one of them is solved, the person can follow the same process to solve the other one.\nOverview Description\nThe coala header in https://api.coala.io/en/latest/ gets scaled only horizontally when viewed using mobile browsers leading to a distortion of the logo. It would be better if the consistency of the logo is maintained.\nSteps to Reproduce\nOpen https://api.coala.io/en/latest/ in any mobile web browser (portrait mode)\nActual Results\n\nExpected Results\nIf the image scales while preserving aspect ratio and is aligned to the center or to the left, the logo would remain round.","comments":6,"createdAt":"2019-01-10T09:30:34Z","updatedAt":"2019-03-02T04:49:07Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"shashank-b","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/22676390?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"shashank-b","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/22676390?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"difficulty/newcomer","color":"0e8a16"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"landing-frontend","updatedAtMs":1551041077000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/landing-frontend/issues/293","number":293,"title":"Add an option of search in dropdown so that no need of sliding to search language ","body":"","comments":3,"createdAt":"2018-11-20T20:31:55Z","updatedAt":"2019-02-24T20:44:37Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"pandeynandancse","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/22164926?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"pandeynandancse","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/22164926?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"difficulty/newcomer","color":"0e8a16"},{"name":"type/bug","color":"ee0701"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"landing-frontend","updatedAtMs":1550085315000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/landing-frontend/issues/289","number":289,"title":"The Language search feature on website is not working","body":"","comments":11,"createdAt":"2018-10-17T10:49:45Z","updatedAt":"2019-02-13T19:15:15Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"PrajwalM2212","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/30733262?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"PrajwalM2212","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/30733262?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"difficulty/medium","color":"dbc255"},{"name":"type/bug","color":"ee0701"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala","updatedAtMs":1551623224000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala/pull/5997","number":5997,"title":"ShowPatchAction.py : Make patches better readable","body":"Print better diffs showing a few context lines\nCloses #5480\n\nFor short term contributors: we understand that getting your commits well\ndefined like we require is a hard task and takes some learning.

As soon as it encounters a control label(eg: for,if,set etc..), it appends those labels into the stack. Note that, we also maintain the end control label where ever necessary. Whenever an control tag is added and if it doesn't find it's endtag in the next line, The Indent step is increased. This is done, because if the endtag is not found on the nextline it basically means that we have nesting of instructions.\nEg:\n{% for tony in avengers %}\n{% for thanos in enemy %}\n{% set thanos == 'EVIL' %}\n{% endfor %}{# for thanos in enemy #}\n{% endfor %}{# for tony in avengers #}\n\nAs you see above after the first for, we do not have an endfor, that means we have a nesting in our Code. In such cases we append the first for in the stack. Now when it goes to the next line, it  checks if the next label matches the end label for the element present in the stack. That means, here we are checking if the next label is endfor. If it is then do nothing.\nIf it's not, then increase the Indent step , which is nothing but the number of spaces that has to be appended infront of a line. And check if the next line has that many number of indent steps. If not then create a diff.\nNow, when it encounters a endtag for the element present in the stack, it does two things\n\nDecreases the Indentaion Step\nPops out the element from the stack.\n\nThis is the basic working of the solution.\nThe above example get's indented as follows:\n{% for tony in avengers %}\n  {% for thanos in enemy %}\n    {% set thanos == 'EVIL' %}\n  {% endfor %}{# for thanos in enemy #}\n{% endfor %}{# for tony in avengers #}\n\nFor the cases where we have a code which has nested languages such as Jinja2 and Python. The lines from other languages are skipped. coala doesn't yet have the functionality to detect multiple languages.\nFor eg:\nimport sys\n{% for tony in avengers %}\n  {% for thanos in enemy %}\n                    print(\"Thanos Rocks!!\")\n          print(\"Testing Indentation\")\n{% set avengers = loose %}\n  {% endfor %}{# for thanos in enemy #}\n{% endfor %}{# for tony in avengers #}\n\nAfter the indentation, it would look like\n{% for tony in avengers %}\n  {% for thanos in enemy %}\n                   print(\"Thanos Rocks!!\")\n          print(\"Testing Indentation\")\n     {% set avengers = loose %}\n  {% endfor %}{# for thanos in enemy #}\n{% endfor %}{# for tony in avengers #}\n\nAs you see above, we provide no indentation to both the print statements. We just ignore them.","diffHunk":null,"author":{"login":"Naveenaidu","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/30195193?v=4","name":"Naveen Naidu"},"createdAt":"2019-02-04T18:25:08Z","lastEditedAt":"2019-02-04T18:31:45Z","updatedAt":"2019-02-04T18:31:45Z"}]}}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala-bears","updatedAtMs":1550502810000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/pull/2814","number":2814,"title":"reSTLintBear.py: Change rst_lint version","body":"This adds support for Sphinx prolog and epilog and other new\nfeatures by changing restructuredtext-lint version from '1.0.0'\nto '1.0' in the files reSTLintBear.py, bear-requirements.txt\nand bear-requirements.yaml.
